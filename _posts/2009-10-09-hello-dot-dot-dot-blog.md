Another blog to clutter the already garbage infested Internet? Yes. But
why?

Why not?

<!--more-->

Seriously though... I've decided to start a blog mainly as a way to share
any discoveries, experiments or interesting knowledge related to technology
that I've come across with whoever is interested. This includes topics such
as computer security, programming, hacks and interesting gadgets.

That's right, this isn't a public diary about my life, what I ate for
breakfast, who stared at me on the subway, or which celebrity flashed the
paparazzi with her naughty bits. Sorry.

With that in mind... hello, blog.
