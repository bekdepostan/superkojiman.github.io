During the Labour Day long weekend I decided to download a handful of [VulnHub](https://vulnhub.com) boot2roots. I had heard some good things about [Necromancer](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/the-necromancer-1,154/), so I thought I'd give it a shot! It's marked as a beginner level, but I started to realize that it was quite different from most boot2roots I'd tackled in the past. 

The initial port scan showed that port 666/UDP was open. 

```

Connecting to it, I received the following string: 

```
You gasp for air! Time is running out!
```

Sending any data would result in the same string being printed out.

After trying various things in vain, I fired up wireshark to see if anything was happening over the network. Lo and behold, something *was* being sent to port 4444 on all IP addresses on the local network:

```
1325    300.770911122   172.16.146.140  172.16.146.139  TCP 66  20684→4444 [ACK] Seq=1426 Ack=2 Win=16384 Len=0 TSval=731717382 TSecr=6714285
```

I setup a netcat listener on port 4444 and eventually the following message was received:

```

```

It was Base64 encoded. Decoding it revealed the following text: 

```
Welcome!

You find yourself staring towards the horizon, with nothing but silence surrounding you.
You look east, then south, then west, all you can see is a great wasteland of nothingness.

Turning to your north you notice a small flicker of light in the distance.
You walk north towards the flicker of light, only to be stopped by some type of invisible barrier.  

The air around you begins to get thicker, and your heart begins to beat against your chest. 
You turn to your left.. then to your right!  You are trapped!

You fumble through your pockets.. nothing!  
You look down and see you are standing in sand.  
Dropping to your knees you begin to dig frantically.

As you dig you notice the barrier extends underground!  
Frantically you keep digging and digging until your nails suddenly catch on an object.

You dig further and discover a small wooden box.  
flag1{e6078b9b1aac915d11b9fd59791030bf} is engraved on the lid.

You open the box, and find a parchment with the following written on it. "Chant the string of flag1 - u666"
```

Got the first of eleven flags. It hinted that I needed to pass the flag to port 666/UDP. 

```
You gasp for air! Time is running out!
flag1{e6078b9b1aac915d11b9fd59791030bf}
Chant is too long! You gasp for air!
e6078b9b1aac915d11b9fd59791030bf
Chant had no affect! Try in a different tongue!
```

Ok... I decided to Google that string, and one of the first hits was from [md5cracker](http://md5cracker.org/decrypted-md5-hash/e6078b9b1aac915d11b9fd59791030bf). It turned out that it was the MD5 hash for "opensesame". So I tried that, and boom:

```
opensesame


A loud crack of thunder sounds as you are knocked to your feet!

Dazed, you start to feel fresh air entering your lungs.

You are free!

In front of you written in the sand are the words:

flag2{c39cd4df8f2e35d20d92c2e44de5f7c6}

As you stand to your feet you notice that you can no longer see the flicker of light in the distance.

You turn frantically looking in all directions until suddenly, a murder of crows appear on the horizon.

As they get closer you can see one of the crows is grasping on to an object. As the sun hits the object, shards of light beam from its surface.

The birds get closer, and closer, and closer.

Staring up at the crows you can see they are in a formation.

Squinting your eyes from the light coming from the object, you can see the formation looks like the numeral 80.

As quickly as the birds appeared, they have left you once again.... alone... tortured by the deafening sound of silence.

666 is closed.
```

Got the second flag!. The message stated that port 80 was now open. 

Browsing to the server on port 80 showed some text and an image. I ran nikto on the target but nothing of interest came up. I decided to look into the image a little. I ran it through a hex editor and noticed that there was something called feathers.txt and that it was in some compressed image:

Using binwalk, I was able to extract the zip file and the text file:

Another Base64 encoded string. Decoding it revealed the following:

```
# cat feathers.txt

```

Got the third flag, and a pointer on where to look next. This time the site hinted that I needed a magical item. I examined the image attached to the site but found nothing of interest. With nothing else to go on, I decided to run a directory scan using gobuster:

```
# gobuster -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://172.16.146.140/amagicbridgeappearsatthechasm/

=====================================================
```

Something called talisman showed up. Browsing to the directory revealed that it was actually a binary, so I downloaded it for further examination. Using radare2, I disassembled the binary and noticed it used a lot of mov statements. I also found several interesting functions:

```
0x08048420    4 43   -> 40   sym.frame_dummy
0x0804844b    4 82           sym.unhide
0x0804849d    4 87           sym.hide
0x080484f4    1 53           sym.myPrintf
0x08048529    1 1024         sym.wearTalisman
0x08048a13    1 36           sym.main
0x08048a37    1 1024         sym.chantToBreakSpell
```

The function chantToBreakSpell() wasn't being called anywhere. I couldn't find any strings, because they were all encoded, but could be decoded using the unhide() function. So when a string had to be printed, it would call myPrintf(), which in turn would call unhide() to print the string, and then encode it again with the hide() function right before exiting myPrintf(). The trick seemed to be to redirect execution of the program to chantToBreakSpell(). There are several ways to do this. What I did was to break at the return instruction at the end of main() in gdb, and then modify $esp to point to  chantToBreakSpell() so main() would return to it. 

Once there, I set a breakpoint at the call to unhide() in myPrintf():

```
0x080484fd      e849ffffff     call sym.unhide
```

This function takes two parameters according to gdb. The first parameter is a pointer to the string to decode, which is what we want. So I took note of the pointer, executed unhide(), and checked the contents of the pointer to view the decoded string. Eventually within chantToBreakSpell(), this happened:

```
0x08048502 in myPrintf ()
gdb-peda$ x/s 0xff94fb94
0xff94fb94: "flag4{ea50536158db50247e110a6c89fcf3d3}\n"
```

Got the fourth flag! I kept stepping through the function and it revealed another clue:

```
gdb-peda$ x/s 0xff94fc0c
0xff94fc0c: "Chant these words at u31337\n"
```

Ok, so this seemed to imply that I should connect to 31337/UDP and send the flag. As before, I found that I had to find the plaintext to the MD5 hash before the service on port 31337 would accept it. In this case, it was "blackmagic":

```
# nc -v -u 172.16.146.140 31337
172.16.146.140: inverse host lookup failed: Unknown host
(UNKNOWN) [172.16.146.140] 31337 (?) open
ea50536158db50247e110a6c89fcf3d3
Chant had no affect! Try in a different tongue!
blackmagic


As you chant the words, a hissing sound echoes from the ice walls.

The blue aura disappears from the cave entrance.

You enter the cave and see that it is dimly lit by torches; shadows dancing against the rock wall as you descend deeper and deeper into the mountain.

You hear high pitched screeches coming from within the cave, and you start to feel a gentle breeze.

The screeches are getting closer, and with it the breeze begins to turn into an ice cold wind.

Suddenly, you are attacked by a swarm of bats!

You aimlessly thrash at the air in front of you!

The bats continue their relentless attack, until.... silence.

Looking around you see no sign of any bats, and no indication of the struggle which had just occurred.

Looking towards one of the torches, you see something on the cave wall.

You walk closer, and notice a pile of mutilated bats lying on the cave floor.  Above them, a word etched in blood on the wall.

/thenecromancerwillabsorbyoursoul

flag5{0766c36577af58e15545f099a3b15e60}
```

Great, got the fifth flag, as well as the next destination. I pointed my browser to http://172.16.146.140/thenecromancerwillabsorbyoursoul and received the sixth flag along with the next clue. Because I'm too lazy to do screenshots right now, here's the HTTP reply from BurpSuite instead:

    In the distance you can see a familiar flicker of light moving in and out of the shadows. <br><br>
    As you get closer to the light you can hear faint footsteps, followed by the sound of a heavy door opening.<br><br>
    You move closer, and then stop frozen with fear.<br><br>
    It's the <a href="./necromancer">necromancer!</a><br><br>

</p><br><br><br>
    Again he stares at you with deathly hollow eyes.  <br><br>
    He is standing in a doorway; a staff in one hand, and an object in the other.  <br><br>
    Smirking, the necromancer holds the staff and the object in the air.<br><br>
    He points his staff in your direction, and the stench of death and decay begins to fill the air.<br><br>
    You stare into his eyes and then.......<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    ...... darkness.  You open your eyes and find yourself lying on the damp floor of the cave.<br><br>
    The amulet must have saved you from whatever spell the necromancer had cast.<br><br>
    You stand to your feet.  Behind you, only darkness.<br><br>
    Before you, a large door with the symbol of a skull engraved into the surface. <br><br>
    Looking closer at the skull, you can see u161 engraved into the forehead.<br><br>

```

So a couple of things here. First off, a link to a file called necromancer, and a newly opened port: 161/UDP. 161/UDP is typically associated with SNMP. Things were starting to get interesting. I downloaded the necromancer file and found that it was a bzip2 file. 

```
# file necromancer 
necromancer: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
```

So I uncompressed it which gave me the following:

```
# tar xvjf necromancer 
necromancer.cap
# file necromancer.cap 
necromancer.cap: tcpdump capture file (little-endian) - version 2.4 (802.11, capture length 65535)
```

A pcap file. I loaded it up into Wireshark for examination and found that it was a wifi capture that had captured a WPA2 handshake. I ran it against aircrack-ng and got the password using the wordlist at [https://download.g0tmi1k.com/wordlists/wifi/renderlab-Church_of_Wifi-9-final-wordlist.zip](https://download.g0tmi1k.com/wordlists/wifi/renderlab-Church_of_Wifi-9-final-wordlist.zip)::

```

Now the SSID for this network was called COMMUNITY, and being that port 161/UDP is SNMP, and to query SNMP we need the community string... well, I figured this must be the community string for the SNMP service. So I decided to give it a go, and it worked:

```
# snmpwalk -v1 -c death2all 172.16.146.140
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: "You stand in front of a door."
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 = STRING: "The door is Locked. If you choose to defeat me, the door must be Unlocked."
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "Fear the Necromancer!"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 = STRING: "Locked - death2allrw!"
End of MIB
```

death2allrw looks like another community string to try, and sure enough it generated a lot of output! 

```
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: "You stand in front of a door."
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: iso.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2.255

iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.9 = STRING: "The MIB modules for managing SNMP Notification, plus filtering."
.

```

Looking through the output, I found some interesting things:

```

```

This community string death2allrw implied that I had read+write access to modify the SNMP settings. So I modified the string "Locked - death2allrw" to "Unlocked - death2allrw" to see what would happen:

```
# snmpset -v1 -c death2allrw 172.16.146.140 iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 s 'Unlocked - death2allrw!'
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 = STRING: "Unlocked - death2allrw!"
```

Query the service again:

```
# snmpwalk -v1 -c death2all 172.16.146.140
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: "You stand in front of a door."
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 = STRING: "The door is unlocked! You may now enter the Necromancer's lair!"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: "Fear the Necromancer!"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 = STRING: "flag7{9e5494108d10bbd5f9e7ae52239546c4} - t22"
End of MIB
```

Nice! It worked, and I got the seventh flag, along with a clue that port 22/TCP was now open. That's typically SSH, so I connected to see what would happen.

```
# ssh necromancer@172.16.146.140

Ok it was open. The flag is the MD5 hash for demonslayer. Assuming that was the user ID, I decided to run a brute force attack on the SSH server using hydra:

```

Perfect! The password for demonslayer was 12345678, so I quickly logged in to see what I was up against.

You enter the Necromancer's Lair!

A stench of decay fills this place.  

Jars filled with parts of creatures litter the bookshelves.

A fire with flames of green burns coldly in the distance.

Standing in the middle of the room with his back to you is the Necromancer.  

In front of him lies a corpse, indistinguishable from any living creature you have seen before.

He holds a staff in one hand, and the flickering object in the other.

"You are a fool to follow me here!  Do you not know who I am!"

The necromancer turns to face you.  Dark words fill the air!

"You are damned already my friend.  Now prepare for your own death!" 

Defend yourself!  Counter attack the Necromancer's spells at u777!
```

The next challenge awaited at port 777/UDP. A quick check with ps revealed that a python script was listening on port 777/UDP

```
$ ps aux

.
.

.
.
.
```

So I connected to it, and was promptly destroyed by the necromancer...

```
$ nc -v -u localhost 777
Connection to localhost 777 port [udp/*] succeeded!

All the ports had been closed and I basically had to start all over again. No problem. I re-did all the steps all over again and scripted it out in case I was defeated yet again and had to start all over.

Ok, back to the challenge at hand. It wanted to know where the Black Robes practice magic of the Greater Path. I Googled "Black Robes" and "Greater Path", and found a Wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsurani#Great_Ones). The answer was "Kelewan":

More Googling, found a Wikipedia entry for [Johann Faust VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Shaman_King_characters#Johann_Faust_VIII), and revealed the answer was Mephistopheles.

Who is tricked into passing the Ninth Gate? 
```

I got this wrong initially, because I thought it was referring to the movie "The Ninth Gate" starring Johnny Depp. It turns out the answer was "Hedge"; a character from [The Old Kingdom Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Old_Kingdom_characters#Hedge):

```
Who is tricked into passing the Ninth Gate?  Hedge

A great flash of light knocks you to the ground; momentarily blinding you!

As your sight begins to return, you can see a thick black cloud of smoke lingering where the Necromancer once stood.

An evil laugh echoes in the room and the black cloud begins to disappear into the cracks in the floor.

The room is silent.

You walk over to where the Necromancer once stood.

On the ground is a small vile.
```

Doing a directory listing showed a new file called .smallvile, which I prompted read:

```

You pick up the small vile.

Inside of it you can see a green liquid.

Opening the vile releases a pleasant odour into the air.

You drink the elixir and feel a great power within your veins!
```

No new files created after this, but I checked if I had any sudo rights and bam:

```
$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for demonslayer on thenecromancer:
    env_keep+="FTPMODE PKG_CACHE PKG_PATH SM_PATH SSH_AUTH_SOCK"

User demonslayer may run the following commands on thenecromancer:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/cat /root/flag11.txt
```

Nice, I could read the final flag! Taking it home:

```
$ sudo /bin/cat /root/flag11.txt



Suddenly you feel dizzy and fall to the ground!

As you open your eyes you find yourself staring at a computer screen.

Congratulations!!! You have conquered......

This was a different kind of boot2root altogether. Definitely more on the CTF side, which was a nice fun change. Cheers to [https://twitter.com/@xerubus](Xerebus) for an awesome challenge!
