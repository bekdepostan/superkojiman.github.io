This is a quick walkthrough on solving the De-ICE S1.120 A challenge which can be downloaded here: [http://vulnhub.com/entry/de-ice_s1120-a,10/](http://vulnhub.com/entry/de-ice_s1120-a,10/). Interestingly, I wasn't aware that this boot2root even existed until a couple of nights ago when someone mentioned it on IRC. After doing a bit of searching, it turns out there are at least three that I haven't had a go at popping. So with that in mind, I decided to load up S1.120 A and take the challenge. 

<!--more-->

De-ICE S1.120 A has a static IP address of 192.168.1.120, so configure your network accordingly to acommodate it. I ran a thorough port scan on the server to identify open TCP and UDP ports:

After a few minutes, TCP ports 21, 22, and 80 were identified, and no UDP ports were found to be open. I fired up my web browser and navigated to http://192.168.1.120 to have a look at the website.

The hyperlinks at the bottom of the wepbage allowed the user to add items into the database and to view items that were in the database. I examined each of these starting with the Add Product link.

I added some random product to see what would happen. I submitted the form and got confirmation that it was added into the database. Since I added text to the price field instead of a numerical price, it just set it to $0.00.

Moving on to the View Products page, I noticed that the dropdown menu had the item that I just added.

Clicking submit returned the information for that item, which was basically what I had entered earlier.

One interesting thing I noticed was the URL had changed to the following:

```
http://192.168.1.120/products.php?id=1
```

I had a hunch there might be some SQL injection vulnerability on the target, so I started enumerating it manually at first, but got no results. Thinking it might be vulnerable to blind SQL injection, I fired up sqlmap to do the heavy lifting for me. 

I ran a simple scan just to see if this worked:

Sure enough, the id parameter was vulnerable to SQL injection, and sqlmap identified the database as MySQL 5.1.33.

I followed up by dumping usernames and hashes:

A huge number of users were identified:

sqlmap asked if I wanted to save the hashes for later cracking, to which I did. I wanted to crack these myself with john

The hashes were saved to /tmp/sqlmaphashes-OIvzPL.txt. I fired up john against the hash file and within a few seconds, 46 of the 50 hashes had already been cracked:

If all of these users had the same password for their SSH login, and if they had user accounts on the server, then I should be able to login now. I picked the first user on the list of cracked accounts, dwestling with password 123456 and logged in usng SSH:

![](/images/2013-12-13/12.png)

This user had no sudo privileges, but with a shell on the target, I was able to do some more enumeration. Looking at the contents of /etc/group, I noticed that user ccoffee was part of the admin group. 

![](/images/2013-12-13/13.png)

I checked the cracked passwords, and found that ccoffee's password was master. I logged out the current SSH session and logged back in as ccoffee. Checking sudo -l revealed that ccoffee could run a script getlogs.sh as root:

![](/images/2013-12-13/14.png)

Running getlogs.sh returns the word "wrong". Unfortunately the permissions on the script prevented me from checking to see what it actually did. It occured to me that I didn't actually need to know what this script did, I could simply replace it with something else. I had write access to the /home/ccoffee/scripts directory, so I simply renamed it and created my own scripts directory with a getlogs.sh symlink to /bin/sh

![](/images/2013-12-13/15.png)

Having symlinked /bin/sh to getlogs.sh, I executed sudo scripts/getlogs.sh and obtained my root shell:

I wasn't sure what the end goal of this challenge was. According to the flags section in [VulnHub](http://vulnhub.com/entry/de-ice_s1120-a,10/), it says various "internal documents". As root I found a personnel.doc in /home/ktso, and a bunch of other text files scattered around other user's home directories. 

Overall this was an easy challenge, which makes it well suited for beginners. I would say having a good knowledge of Linux and the basics of hacking techniques and tools would be enough to complete it.
