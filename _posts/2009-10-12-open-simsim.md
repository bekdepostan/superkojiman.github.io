There've been a few times where I've found myself in need of a default username/password for a wireless router that has been factory reset, or was just improperly configured. Going through manufacturer websites searching for the manuals and the information can be a pain. 

<!--more-->

Fortunately there are already a few resources online that provide lists of default credentials for various devices. So why not just use that? Well, having a local copy is nice because sometimes I may not have Internet access, or I may want to format the results in a different way so I can pipe it into another program.

That's where opensesame comes in. It's a python script that queries a sqlite3 database containing the default credentials for certain devices. This database was created using the publicly available default password list at [http://www.phenoelit-us.org/dpl/dpl.html](http://www.phenoelit-us.org/dpl/dpl.html)

opensesame will search the database looking for parameters specifed by the user such as vendor, model or both and displays the results. For example, searching for the default credentials for a Linksys WRT54G router yields several results, one of which is:

```
Vendor: linksys
Model: wrt54g
Version: 
Access Type: Multi
Username: admin
Password: admin
Privileges: Admin
Notes: Router / VoIP Gateway (@ 192.168.3.1)
```

The included README file contains more examples and information.
