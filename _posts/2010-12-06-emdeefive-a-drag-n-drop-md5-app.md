I got frustrated with Windows not having a default program for checking the MD5 hash of a file, so I wrote my own. It's written in Java and has been tested on Windows and OS X, although it should work on any system that has a JRE installed. To use it, just drag the file(s) whose hashes you need to check into the window and it will display the MD5 and SHA-1 hashes for you.

I've released it under the MIT license, the download includes the program as well as the source code.
