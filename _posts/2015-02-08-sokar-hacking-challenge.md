To commemorate their second birthday, [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com) is holding another competition with the promise of prizes for those who are chosen as winners! The challenge is Sokar; a nefarious boot2root created by [rasta_mouse](https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse) which features a nice balance of frustration and satisfaction. For more details about the competition, head over to VulnHub's [blog post](http://blog.vulnhub.com/2015/01/competition-sokar.html). I spent a couple of hours each evening after work to poke away at Sokar until I finally solved it. This post contains my walkthrough.

Solving Sokar took a bit of work, and writing it all up is rather tiresome. Therefore I've decided to share my solution using a different medium, which I hope you enjoy:

Sokar was a lot of fun. If you complete it, don't forget to submit a writeup for a chance to win prizes! VulnHub has offered fantastic prizes in the past which include gift cards, t-shirts, and challenge coins. Don't miss out on it!
