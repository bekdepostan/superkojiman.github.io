Once upon a time I used to write tutorials for a site called
Linuxnewbie.org

Linuxnewbie had this idea to create really easy to understand tutorials for
newcomers to Linux. I became actively involved in the forums and in writing
tutorials for the site. Some of my tutorials were actually popular enough
that they got posted on other Linux sites and even translated to other
languages.

Linuxnewbie.org has since changed ownership and is now
[JustLinux.com](http://www.justlinux.com) and I'm no longer
actively involved in the site, although I visit it once in a blue moon.
Anyway, I'm posting the tutorials here since some of them are still useful, but 
be warned that some are very old and may no longer be relevant today. 

* [Introduction to BASH shell scripting](http://www.techorganic.com/tutorials/bash_scripting.pdf)
