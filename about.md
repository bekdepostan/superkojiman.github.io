I'm system administrator, programmer, and computer security enthusiast. This blog was started as a means to encourage me to continuously learn new and cool things, and to share it with others who might find it interesting. An online portfolio if you will.  

Some contributions I've made to the community include the [Brainpan](https://www.vulnhub.com/?q=Brainpan&sort=date-asc&type=vm) challenges, and handful of [exploits](http://www.exploit-db.com/author/?a=5530). I also participate in CTF events as a member of the [VulnHub CTF Team](https://ctf-team.vulnhub.com). 

Although I'm not in infosec professionally, I've obtained the [OSCP](http://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) and [OSCE](http://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/osce-offensive-security-certified-expert/) certifications to challenge myself, and simply because I thought it would be a fun massive CTF. 

You can reach me by email, or follow me on Twitter using the buttons at the bottom of this page.
